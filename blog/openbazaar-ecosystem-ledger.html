<meta name="description" content="In these posts we take a look at some unique members of the OpenBazaar ecosystem. Today our featured shop is Ledger, a leading producer of hardware wallets in the entire cryptocurrency space! Read their story below and shop Ledger on OpenBazaar. Just want to browse? Check them out on Duosearch and at LedgerWallet.com   ** Tell us a bit about yourself? ** We’re Ledger, a hardware security company manufacturing hardware wallets. We’re a team composed of 18 people, most of them engineers (electronics/hardware, software, design…) including a team of security veterans with 20 years of experience in the secure element industry. Our company has been selling its products for almost two years now. **What do you make or sell? ** We design, develop, manufacture and sell cryptocurrency hardware wallets based on Secure Elements. Our first product the Ledger Nano was a commercial success, and we now manufacture more advanced devices featuring screens and buttons (Ledger Nano S), touchscreen, Bluetooth and NFC (Ledger Blue, coming next month). Those new devices allow users to develop their own applications and to extend their capabilities: right now, they support Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, FIDO Authentication, SSH and PGP, but more apps and uses are coming. We sell in more than 200 countries. **Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? ** We like the idea of a decentralized marketplace as much as the idea of the decentralized currency! **How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? ** Good! Creating a listing, selling and communicating with customers is easy and our server has been running smoothly for the last 6 months. There is one thing, however,  preventing us (and similar or bigger companies) from selling most of the time: there is no granular management of shipping and taxes (see last question). **How familiar are you with Bitcoin? ** Some people at Ledger have a significant Bitcoin balance, and our engineers understand how Bitcoin works, which is of course crucial to developing our firmwares, software and backends. **What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you? ** We think it is very important for OpenBazaar to implement granular (but of course optional) shipping and taxes management. Companies should be able, for each listing, to set a shipping cost and a tax rate for each destination country, using an “Expert Mode” or something similar. This would cover most, if not all, problems arising when selling worldwide. When a cost or a tax changes, OpenBazaar won’t even have to change anything: the user can simply change his parameters." />
