<meta name="description" content="In these posts we take a look at some unique members of the OpenBazaar ecosystem. Today our featured shop is Coffee Milk Syrup and it’s pretty much what it sounds like, shop owner Adana makes her own “coffee syrup” that’s like chocolate syrup—just made with coffee! You can find Coffee Milk Syrup on OpenBazaar, on Duosearch and at CoffeeMilkSyrup.cf     Tell us a bit about yourself? I make coffee syrup during the day, and I’m a writer, and a web developer at night. I’m originally from Houston, TX, though I’m currently living in Dallas. What do you make? I make Some Awesome Coffee Syrup. It’s similar to chocolate syrup, but it’s made with coffee, so it makes everything taste like coffee. Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? I work from home, and getting your product or service out there is hard to do sometimes. I saw OpenBazaar as a way to put myself into a market that would likely appreciate that, and that I was in full control of. I was originally with OpenBazaar when you guys first launched, and I joined in and made a quick store, and within just a few days I had my first sell. With the products that I make and sell, It’s hard to get customers without doing a lot of actual footwork: going to stores, food trucks, and vendors alike, locally. That also limited me on how I was able to sell my product and I think OpenBazaar is exactly where I need to be to get my big start with Coffee Syrup. How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? My experience has been great. I am in the Slack community for OpenBazaar and the admin, vendors, and people in general are very helpful and polite. I’ve had questions ranging from “How would I setup my name properly” all the way to “how do I migrate my OB server from Windows to Linux” and I’ve had all of my questions answered thoroughly. The community for OpenBazaar is full of great people. How familiar are you with Bitcoin? Quite familiar with it. I have traded across the exchanges and used bitcoin locally to buy food, or books even. I like the usability of it and of course bitcoin contracts are amazing for vendors like myself. What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you? I think that implementing a similar system to “Reviews” would be nice, but have it be something along the lines of “Store Updates,” similar to “News” I suppose. This way, when a store are preparing to put items on sale, say for the Black Friday event, the customers or people that come to the store would be able to know about the sale, through looking at the updates/news tab. This would help keep the customers in the know about products. If I only had a limited amount of items, I could make a post about how it has a limited inventory and how long the sale would last. It would help with customer questions. Any scheduled downtime could be listed there as well, as about once a week, I take my store offline for about 3-4 hours for system updates." />
