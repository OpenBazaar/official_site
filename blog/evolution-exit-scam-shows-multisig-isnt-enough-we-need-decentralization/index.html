Also, multisig might protect funds, but it doesn’t prevent the platform from shutting down altogether. The solution is to move away from the centralized systems completely. Removing the middleman will have enormous benefits for users. Consider the following benefits of decentralized markets:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Markets are persistent</strong>. There’s no central point of control that can be taken down, either by outside actors or internal ones.</li>
  <li><strong>Funds aren’t centrally controlled</strong>. There’s no central authority to trust and no jackpot to steal. Individuals control their funds directly and likely use multisig for transactions.</li>
  <li><strong>No fees</strong>. Trade occurs directly between parties; there’s no site operator to take a cut.</li>
  <li><strong>No data aggregation</strong>. Site operators (and data thieves) profit from aggregation of data on centralized systems, but there’s no single trove of data on decentralized system.</li>
  <li><strong>Trust and reputation are dynamic</strong>. In a centralized system, you are forced to trust the site operators, and the reputation system is static (as determined by site operators). In a decentralized system, you aren’t forced to trust any parties, and reputation systems can emerge without any control or censorship by central authorities.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately for everyone on the internet, decentralized markets are still in their infancy. Over the last eight months OpenBazaar has teased the community with a taste of what the future of trade looks like. We are pushing hard, and are closer than ever to making it a reality. We know you wanted it yesterday, but our mission is not just to push out a product. Our goal is to create an open protocol for trade that will give users to power to push aside the central institutions that control online trade, and begin trading freely. It’s not a simple task, but with your help we’re getting close.</p>
