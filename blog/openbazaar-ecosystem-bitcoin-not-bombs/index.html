<meta name="description" content="In these posts we take a look at some unique members of the OpenBazaar ecosystem. Today our featured shop is Bitcoin Not Bombs, another of our great community members that has been active from day 1! Read their story below and shop Bitcoin Not Bombs on OpenBazaar. Just want to browse? Check them out on Duosearch and at BitcoinNotBombs.com     Tell us a bit about yourself? My background is in media production but I don’t get to do much of that these days. In 2008 I became interested in economics and caught the silver bug and alternative currencies became a hobby of mine. When I first heard about Bitcoin in 2011 I was immediately intrigued. In 2012 I started selling silver dime cards on Bitmit.net and began working with Davi Barker on creating more products we could sell. In 2013 Davi and I took the Bitcoin Not Bombs product line to the first US Bitcoin conference in San Jose, we were blown away by the response. We knew this would be a great niche market but at that one event we sold out of almost everything we had. Back then people were buying products for bitcoin just to show support for the currency. I see a lot of that same excitement with OpenBazaar today. The Bitcoin Not Bombs logo has been printed on t-shirts, hoodies, lapel pins, patches, stickers, shot glasses and other small items over the last few years. We have also collaborated on a few large art projects like the world’s first coin operated voting machine. The brand and logo means different things to different people and we like it that way. These days we have reduced our inventory to only the small items sold on OpenBazaar and Purse.io. Many of Davi’s t-shirt designs can be found at store.bitcoin.com and a lot of our work goes to supporting antiwar efforts. Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? Because it matters, though I’m somewhat disappointed that less than 300 vendors are still actively selling items on the network. I know thousands more have downloaded the client and set up stores but lost interest. In the summer of ‘15 one of the OB developers asked us if we could list our small low risk items when the software became available. I was ready with our first listing on day one, a lapel pin that supports the FreeRoss.org campaign. In some ways OpenBazaar is the conclusion of the Silk Road experiment, I wanted people to see that connection and offer this lapel pin from the beginning. How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? Great! Things where buggy in the beginning but I was happy to ride that out, I saw the development team pushing updates constantly so I knew it would get better fast. Things run very smooth now and I still get a few orders a month, I suspect everyone will see a second wave of orders once version 2.0 is available. How familiar are you with Bitcoin? Fairly familiar, I’m not a programmer or computer expert but I have read a lot of technical information on how Bitcoin works. One reason I stuck with it was that I knew it would only be a few years before the wallets became extremely easy to use. At this point you don’t need to know how Bitcoin works under the hood to use it, but a better understanding of the technology will lead to more adoption. What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you? Not having a way to combined shipping cost on orders is my biggest complaint, but I have seen that a better shopping cart system will become available in version 2.0 along with variable data like size and color. Does your store have any special promotions? For Bitcoin Black Friday we will offer free US shipping and a free gift for international orders." />
