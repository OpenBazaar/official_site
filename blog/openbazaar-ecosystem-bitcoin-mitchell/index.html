I am Mitchell, a 22 year old IT professional with a Bachelor’s degree who is currently working as a backend developer. I’ve been into Bitcoin since 2013, but heard about it in 2012 from a friend of mine. I did look into it at the time, but downloading the Blockchain took me too long so I quit and never looked back until a year later. When I started with Bitcoin I was a standard newbie. I didn’t know much about Bitcoin and mostly visited faucets. After a while I found out about BitVegas (now defunct) and starting going there quite often. They had the highest paying faucet at that point in time, but I usually just spent it on the games they had. My favorites were the pig races and the roulette table. I got my first 3BTC from there as there was a discussion between two people and their point of argument was that rich people could help more than poor people because they had the resources to do so. Anyway, to prove their point someone started randomly gifting people Bitcoins. Lucky me! Around this time I started my own website named BitcoinInformation.info where I wanted to put some information about Bitcoin (I wrote it as BitCoin back then). With the Bitcoins I received I set up my first faucet, which also caused me to register my Bitcointalk account (now called Mitchell, instead of BitcoinInformation). I was the first one to offer both direct Bitcoin withdrawals and Peerbet withdrawals." />

                    <p>In these posts we take a look at some unique members of the OpenBazaar ecosystem. Today our featured shop is Bitcoin Mitchell, the OpenBazaar outpost of one of our very active community members! You can find Bitcoin Mitchell on <a href="ob://5afb9b734be90e4c5e92e35e8baf67b200ca5f44">OpenBazaar</a>, on <a href="Screen-Shot-2016-10-17-at-1.58.15-PM.png">Duosearch</a> and at <a href="http://www.bitcoininformation.info/">BitcoinInformation.info</a> <a href="Screen-Shot-2016-10-17-at-1.58.15-PM.png"><img src="Screen-Shot-2016-10-17-at-1.58.15-PM.png" alt="Bitcoin Mitchell Store on OpenBazaar" /></a>   <strong>Tell us a bit about yourself?</strong> I am Mitchell, a 22 year old IT professional with a Bachelor’s degree who is currently working as a backend developer. I’ve been into Bitcoin since 2013, but heard about it in 2012 from a friend of mine. I did look into it at the time, but downloading the Blockchain took me too long so I quit and never looked back until a year later. When I started with Bitcoin I was a standard newbie. I didn’t know much about Bitcoin and mostly visited faucets. After a while I found out about <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=143554.0">BitVegas</a> (now defunct) and starting going there quite often. They had the highest paying faucet at that point in time, but I usually just spent it on the games they had. My favorites were the pig races and the roulette table. I got my first 3BTC from there as there was a discussion between two people and their point of argument was that rich people could help more than poor people because they had the resources to do so. Anyway, to prove their point someone started randomly gifting people Bitcoins. Lucky me! Around this time I started my own website named <a href="http://BitcoinInformation.info">BitcoinInformation.info</a> where I wanted to put some information about Bitcoin (I wrote it as BitCoin back then). With the Bitcoins I received I set up my first faucet, which also caused me to register my <a href="https://bitcointalk.org">Bitcointalk</a> account (now called Mitchell, instead of BitcoinInformation). I was the first one to offer both direct Bitcoin withdrawals and Peerbet withdrawals.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Original announcement thread: <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=308609.0">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=308609.0</a></li>
  <li>This is how my website looked in 2013: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130827021332/http://www.bitcoininformation.info/">https://web.archive.org/web/20130827021332/http://www.bitcoininformation.info/</a></li>
  <li>I did do a nice redesign for the faucet later on: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131024014411/http://www.bitcoininformation.info/faucet.php">https://web.archive.org/web/20131024014411/http://www.bitcoininformation.info/faucet.php</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I kept the faucet running till 13 December 2013 and BitVegas ended up as a scam during the same month, which was a huge disappointment to me. I spent a lot of time there, made a few Bitcoins, helped BitVegas out with moderating and even helped build their new map. Well, such is life. Going on, I stayed on Bitcointalk and on 07 January 2015 I became the Dutch Moderator, mostly because I happened to be quite active. Eventually I was assigned as a Patroller as well and started moderating two more sections (Project Development and Beginners &amp; Help). <strong>What do you make/sell?</strong> I’m currently selling some left over Steam gifts and <a href="http://silverwallets.com/">Silver Wallets</a>, which I am the official seller for on both OpenBazaar and Bitcointalk. And yes, we will be doing a Black Friday sale. ;) <strong>Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar?</strong> I like getting Silver Wallets out to the masses as it’s an amazing looking coin. Also, OB seems like a platform that could get to an eBay level so I would like to be involved with it before this happens. <strong>How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far?</strong> Setting up OB was pretty easy on Windows, but when I tried to migrate to a VPS I couldn’t because the DB contained absolute paths. I reported this and it was quickly fixed. After this small hiccup I setup OB on my VPS and it has been running pretty smoothly after setting up a script that checks the OB store servers and restarts it if need be. <strong>How familiar are you with Bitcoin?</strong> I’m pretty familiar with Bitcoin and how it works. I wouldn’t call myself an expert or even good as I don’t know the exact technical details, but I know enough to understand how it works and I’m able to explain it to others. <strong>What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you?</strong> IPFS would be an amazing start same as TOR support. I’ve missed quite a few messages because of how OB currently works, so IPFS would be a great improvement. Other than that, plugins/extensions would be pretty neat. A very useful example would be Slack integration so that I can be notified on a Slack channel about a product that has been bought.</p>
