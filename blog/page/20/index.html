                    This week another darknet market closed abruptly. The Evolution site operators stole millions of dollars worth of users’ bitcoins. This is only the latest in a series of “exit scams” where the operators of these centralized markets will run legitimately for months, even years, and then run off with all the funds at once. When previous exit scams occurred, the proposed solution was implementing multisignature into the marketplaces. Users were told to only use marketplaces that offered multisig. This does make the users’ funds more secure – in theory. In practice, even though multisig was available in Evolution, it wasn’t widely used. People still trusted the centralized site operators with their Bitcoin.  Why would people still misplace their trust when this pattern has become obvious? One reason is that they are dealing with illegal items. Not all items on darknet markets are illegal, but a substantial portion are. They have no legal recourse if something goes wrong. This means they look for the most trusted site in operation, the one with the largest network of other users. As the number of users increases, so does the notoriety, publicity, and demands on the site infrastructure. With the increased stress and scrutiny on the system, the site operators have little margin for error. If something does go wrong, or the pressure becomes too intense, then those site operators will exit while they still can, taking down the entire system. Even in legal marketplaces, centralized systems share this flaw. The single point of control gives site operators the ability to determine the fate of the platform, and all its users. How can this be prevented? We’ve already mentioned multisig. Evolution implemented it, but did so in a way that was intended to still retain power over users’ funds. They required users to deposit funds with them, and then move them into the multisig later. A centralized site operator doesn’t want to give up their ability to extract fees from its users, so they don’t have a strong incentive to make multisig easy to use. Also, multisig might protect funds, but it doesn’t prevent the platform from shutting down altogether. The solution is to move away from the centralized systems completely. Removing the middleman will have enormous benefits for users. Consider the following benefits of decentralized markets:

                    Our team is exited to announce that the OpenBazaar project has been selected as one of Black Duck’s Open Source Rookies of the Year. Each year, Black Duck names ten new open source projects as their Rookies of the Year. Former winners include Bootstrap, Ansible, Docker, Tox, and many other amazing projects. We’re honored to be acknowledged alongside such great projects as well as the other rookies this year. We’d like to thank the community for their enthusiastic support of the project, as well as the dedicated group of volunteers who maintains the project. 2014 was a great beginning to the project, but 2015 will see OpenBazaar move out of beta and into a platform that can be used for free trade online, with Bitcoin, anywhere in the world. Let’s make trade free together.

                    We recently faced a minor security incident at the OpenBazaar GitHub repository. An attacker was able to briefly gain push access and make code changes that remained undetected for about one hour, by pretending to be a developer with contributor access who lost access to his normal account. The changes that the attacker made to the code were insignificant and were not related to security – they were mostly tests. Only the “develop” branch was affected, not the “master” branch. As our users run the “master” branch, we expect no users to be affected by this breach. We reverted the code changes immediately and access rights were restored. We don’t expect anyone to be affected by this attack. As a response to the attack, we are on the process of developing more rigorous security policies which would require proper authentication for committer username changes. Our new policies will also include operational security requirements for existing developers. In response to the attack and in coordination with GitHub, we have ensured that the accounts of the attacker have been appropriately banned. As part of our transparency commitment to our users, we are publishing this security incident so that people are aware of our potential problems and solutions. Our full incident response post-mortem report is made available for the community to read.

                    OpenBazaar is now almost eight months old. We’ve grown from myself to over 58 contributors over the life of the project, with a community response that has been overwhelming at times. One of the largest challenges of a project like this is building and maintaining a great team. Take an open source project, intentionally make it unfunded with no profit model, and now you have a much more difficult challenge. For the last eight months we have had little to no worries in this department as our core team has slowly grown. Unfortunately, that could not last forever. Since our team is contributing in their spare hours and have families, jobs, and other obligations, several particpants have had to reduce their contributions to the project. We recently announced an approach to move to a team-based development structure where individuals would be responsible for different aspects of the project. This was in response to the team growing quickly and myself and the core devs feeling like this would be a better way to manage everything going on. I wondered if this might be a little premature to do so, but it felt right considering the team we had put together. Now we have recently lost a few team members due to several factors and who will now be serving in a diminished capacity as they tend to their other responsibilities. This change means we need to refocus our efforts and be realistic about how the project will progress. To be clear, while the number of contributors has decreased, we still have a good team and we’re confident that we can deliver a full release in a reasonable amount of time. I’m making this post because we decided early on that the OpenBazaar project would be as transparent and honest with the community as possible, so when we have new developments we put that information out as soon as possible. I am currently working with the core devs to distill down our future plans into critical areas that need to get done. We will be simplifying and stepping back to ensure we tackle only the most necessary pieces of our software. The first priority is the p2p network. Our second priority is the trading protocol. Finally we will continue to improve the user interface and push towards the vision of a standalone app that works across all platforms. [caption id=”” align=”alignright” width=”340”] This train keeps rolling.[/caption] As we rolled out our current solution we have run into several issues around our infrastructure that’s in place. One critical decision we made was that in order to support Tor we stuck with TCP-based connections between peers using ZeroMQ. We have tried many different approaches, but it seems like using ZeroMQ in this p2p capacity may be a tough road ahead. We are currently investigating several other approaches including moving to UDP-based networking and leveraging proven libraries like libtorrent who have solved many of the connectivity problems we are experiencing, while still allowing use of Tor. This should be exciting and we hope this work will bear fruit soon. If you have any p2p networking experience and would like to help us tackle this problem please reach out. We’d love to have your help. Our next big focus area will be on the trading protocol, which we will be calling the OpenBazaar Marketplace Protocol (OBMP). There are many details of how this will work and what will be included, but we believe that by clearly defining the protocol and what is expected between nodes to communicate and peers to trade we will improve the stability and security of the network as a whole. More details to be released soon on this.

                    There is something terrifying yet beautiful about the concept of a truly digital culture. As a father of two young boys I take a stab at guessing what life will be like in 20 years and it actually seems kind of scary. In the last several years we’ve seen selfies, multi-billion dollar companies run by early 20-somethings and despicable crimes and corruption by people we supposedly trusted in positions of authority throughout the political and financial community.

                    Note: This blog post is outdated. Read this article for the latest code. Since the project began in April, the number of people contributing to the OpenBazaar project has steadily grown. We now have enough people to create small teams dedicated to specific areas. These teams will allow the project to focus on areas that are important, and not duplicate efforts. This team creation has already been occurring spontaneously, but we’ve decided to make it more formal as we keep developing the platform. It’s likely that these teams, their mission, and their members will change over time as we figure out what works and what doesn’t. As the project lead, Brian Hoffman will work with these teams to make sure they are heading in the right direction. Each team has their own mission, and the core mission of OpenBazaar is “To enable global free trade online.” We’ve identified 11 areas we want to have teams focusing on;

                    Today we are announcing the OpenBazaar Developer Network or ‘OBDN’. We recently asked for volunteers to help with the front-end development of the OpenBazaar client, and we’re pleasantly surprised to receive more than 20 responses from volunteers in only the first week. We realized that there are many people who want to contribute to the online free trade movement, but they aren’t sure how to get involved. In order to bring in more developers to help make OpenBazaar a reality, we decided to begin creating the OpenBazaar Developer Network (OBDN). It will be a platform that allows a community of OpenBazaar developers to share their ideas, collaborate on how best to implement these ideas, and then make them a reality. OBDN will allow the community to propose new features and vote on which features they want to see implemented. The OpenBazaar team leads found here will use the OBDN to find help for specific tasks within their areas. APIs and other tools will be available for developers who wish to build plugins or new services on top of the OpenBazaar network. To ensure that we are working with developers who genuinely want to contribute, we plan on OBDN being invitation only. There will be an application process for access to the network once we have a functional beta, which we hope to roll out in mid-January. If you’re interested in helping build this platform with us, please contact Braden Glasgow. Email: braden@openbazaar.org  Twitter: @bradenglasgow

                    Note: This blog post is outdated. Read this article for the latest code. The third OpenBazaar beta release is now available. With this release, we’re starting the tradition of naming our releases after great bazaars from all around the world, with the first being Tabriz, a market in Iran which is one of the oldest bazaars in the Middle East. Tabriz represents a significant amount of work for our developers, with more than 350 commits, and merging more than 70 pull requests from the community. We thank everyone who contributed. One of the major improvements in Tabriz is the ability to run on Windows. If you’d like to become a beta tester, download the Windows binary [signature here], unzip the file and run the OpenBazaar.exe file. In case our site goes down, you can get a torrent with this magnet link. For a full list of changes in Tabriz, check out the changelog.
