                    In these posts we take a look at some unique members of the OpenBazaar ecosystem. Today we are featuring the evolving store tsnieman by Tyler Nieman who has several items listed now including his original art prints, tech gear and web development services while he defines his focus. That’s part of the beauty of OpenBazaar, you don’t have to have it all figured out to get started! You can view Tyler Nieman’s store in your browser or on OpenBazaar here.      Tell us a bit about yourself? My name is Tyler Nieman and I’m a full-stack web developer/designer, artist, gamer, and general all-around nerd currently living in Tacoma, WA. I run @tsnieman on OpenBazaar. How did you find out about OpenBazaar? Probably by means of some Bitcoin-related subreddit. I’ve been learning a lot more about decentralization and cryptocurrencies in general lately, and OpenBazaar is a big name in that space. What do you make/sell? A lot of different stuff with no real specialty carved out yet. Right now I’ve got: some 12x18 locally screen-printed posters of my original Fox-themed artwork, rare vinyl (The Weeknd’s “Trilogy”, hand-numbered), some computer parts, a mechanical keyboard (with some fun free keycaps!), and my own by-the-hour full-stack development and design services. Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? I think decentralization is a very powerful concept and I’m excited to learn more about it. OpenBazaar seems like a great way to do that. It’s proving a great way to learn about how decentralized markets can work, cryptocurrencies, open source development, and even just general server maintenance practice. It’s a great way to network with other people in the space too. How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? Fantastic for such an early version of the concept! I’ve only been up and running for a week or two, so I haven’t had any real sales. I’ve made a purchase (shoutout to Cryptobooks!) and I’m eagerly awaiting the arrival of “The Internet of Money”, a book by Andreas Antonopoulos. I’m finding so many great shops online by so many talented people. I’m hoping to open up another shop or two with more focused themes, as I really believe in what OpenBazaar could be. How familiar are you with Bitcoin? I learned about it years ago, when it was first coming out, though I didn’t get into playing with it until 2013 or so (what a shame, right?). It wasn’t until the last year or two that it really started to become a serious hobby/interest. Since then, I’ve consumed a lot of Satoshi’s writings, bought a few hardware wallets (shoutout to LedgerHQ -- check out their OpenBazaar shop!), got a few friends interested, dabbled in other cryptoassets, started connecting people with Bitcoin in the area, and recently started a local Tacoma Bitcoin interest group. I’m hoping to compile some educational material and educate more local folk soon. What changes would you like to see in OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you? Aside from all the awesome work coming in OpenBazaar 2.0, more folks on the platform and shopping would be the biggest improvement. I would also really love if there was a way to see some analytics like number of vendors online (and over time), number of sales per day, etc, though I imagine that getting people on OpenBazaar and making sales is first priority. I’m excited to see how OB1 helps grow OpenBazaar’s community and tech with their most recent round of fundraising. Tyler cited this video OB1 CEO Brian Hoffman made recently that demonstrates some of the development work to date toward Milestone 1 of version 2.0:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOHfPsSzyNg

                       Today we’ve released version 1.1.10 with a special integration that we are excited to share. Since our launch we have received many requests for the ability to use other cryptocurrencies within OpenBazaar and ShapeShift’s Shifty Button provides a simple solution. A workable demonstration of this functionality was produced at the hackathon OB1 co-hosted with Duosearch in London by Justin of Duosearch and community member Barry.

                    The OpenBazaar ecosystem features hundreds of vendors from around the world who want to list their goods and services for free, set their prices, and get paid in bitcoin. Buyers can purchase items ranging from clothing, food, electronics and home decor to applied services and digital products in this marketplace and often for lower prices than those available elsewhere on the web. In these posts we take a look at some unique members of the OpenBazaar ecosystem. Today we are featuring Honey France (Best Honey on Earth), a quaint little store selling delicious French honey from their own family-kept bees and trying to make the world a better place. They are no strangers to using Bitcoin and have a pioneering story that will make your stomach drop a little! You can find Honey France on OpenBazaar here and browse their listings on the web here.      How did you find out about OpenBazaar? Since we work with computers and are admirers of open source initiatives, we have been following the development of OpenBazaar with interest, after reading about it on the bitcointalk forum. What do you make/sell? We mainly sell our honey production of the year, but shipping costs remain our main concern. Recently, we added two donation initiatives to help save the bees: a small donation, since the bitcoin simplifies micro-payments, or to adopt a queen from one of our hives for a season and to be more involved in the preservation of pollinators, who are essential to our survival. In the same principle, we will propose the adoption of a whole hive for the season: the “Bee part of the solution” project ;-) Soon, we will add honey &amp; spice mixes for your gourmet recipes. For our honey, we had fun writing an offbeat description addressed to “geeks”, most likely the early-adopters of OpenBazaar. Have a look at the presentation page of one of our jars of honey on Duosear.ch. Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? We like all decentralization initiatives. This is probably a habit of those of us who live in the French countryside, since our politicians and leaders think that only Paris exists in France ;-) We also like the idea of introducing the bitcoin to others: reduction of fraud, no borders, Escrow system, micro-payments… So finally, it’s not only because there is no fee that we prefer OpenBazaar to eBay. How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? We started the adventure by installing OpenBazaar on our family iMac and then to avoid leaving it on permanently, we transferred our store to a RaspberryPi II. But the server was unstable and difficult to monitor, so we decided to install it on a dedicated server. This was not the initial idea, since we didn’t want subscription fees for our store. After an unsuccessful installation on an existing hosted server (mostly difficulties installing the libsodium library), we had the pleasure of using the Deploy solution from OB1 where everything was installed in 1 click. We are hoping that version 2 of OpenBazaar will be released before the end of our 2 free months with DigitalOcean :-) We didn’t expect a miracle when we opened our honey store. We have been faced with expensive international shipping fees for heavy jars, and current visitors are not really interested in this kind of product, since they generally prefer to buy locally. Our two other offers may be more successful: the protection &amp; survival of bees is an international challenge. But using OpenBazaar is not limited to opening a store, we also made some purchases and enjoy this great marketplace. For a first version, all the processes were very well thought out. How familiar are you with Bitcoin? We were among the first to mine bitcoins, when it was only experimental (as admin of an Xserve farm). We are virtual millionaires, like many who started mining bitcoins at the beginning, never imaging how valuable it would become. We lost our key by the replacement hard drives or other breakdowns, and it was only in 2013 that we cried when we discovered the fortune and number of hives we could have had, with the several thousand bitcoins we had mined at the very beginning. That’s learning about the crypto world the hard way. ;-) What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you? With the arrival of Duosearch, the link between the web and OpenBazaar has become easier, but it’s not enough. In addition to a currency still too confidential, the need to install a special software to purchase on the platform doesn’t help. Fortunately, the great diversity of products available has aroused the curiosity of some adventurers. For mainstream use, the acquisition of bitcoins by OpenBazaar shoppers needs to be facilitated, even if they only acquire them for their purchases, and without having to install a client software. It is our understanding that these 2 improvements are planned, including the evolutions related to shipping fees, which is essential, and the addition of visitor statistics, which will motivate us from time to time. Finally, we would like to add a very specific request: to be able to present our store in different languages. Currently, the UI adapts to French, but the product descriptions remain in one language. We would like to present our products in the native language of our potential and probably our main customers, given the cost of shipping. And also in English so that the whole world can discover our products (and why not in German/Italian/Spanish, our close neighbors). But please not an automatic translator, that would be catastrophic. As you can see, we are impatiently awaiting version 2 because it looks very promising. Good luck to the developers!

                    We’re pleased to announce that OB1 has raised a new round of funding in order to make OpenBazaar the most free and open trade platform in the world. Last year, OpenBazaar entered a new phase when the core development team received funding to create a company in order to properly develop the peer-to-peer trade platform. OB1 worked hard, together with developers from the community, to release OpenBazaar 1.0 in April. Seeing people around the world trading without middlemen and only using Bitcoin has been exciting, and after learning how to make major improvements we’re now working to make peer-to-peer trade better than ever with the 2.0 version of the software. Details of the new funding are in the press release below. We’re fortunate to have investors who understand the value of networks, decentralization, and Bitcoin. We believe that with such good investors, developers, and our community, we can fundamentally change how online commerce is done. Let’s make trade free!

                    In these posts we take a look at some unique members of the OpenBazaar ecosystem. Today we are featuring Kimchi Clothing (Director Nola), a brand new store on OpenBazaar that will be featuring socks and hand-tailored clothing. You can find Kimchi Clothing (Director Nola) on OpenBazaar here.      Tell us a bit about yourself? I’m Jason, originally from New Orleans, Louisiana but been living in South Korea since 2013. I been living outside of the U.S. since 2008. Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? I am selling on open OB because I want to earn income in bitcoin that will cover my living expenses and build a savings. I believe in Bitcoin and the movement. I want to become an advocate for the community. What do you make/sell? I sell socks and I tailor suits from South Korea right now. How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? I need to setup hosting my store on a server instead of my laptop. That way I can be open 24/7. (UPDATE: the shop has been moved to a Digital Ocean VPS using OB1’s Deploy tool!) How familiar are you with Bitcoin? I am super familiar in bitcoin. I am saving and doing business with bitcoin. What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you? Right now, I don’t see any changes since I am still learning how to use it like a pro.   BONUS: Check out this special video Jason made that is the first in his new series discussing blockchain! https://youtu.be/j2GMPwVSORE
