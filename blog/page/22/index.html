                    This blog post outlines the security model and policies of OpenBazaar. It is written for contributors with push access who are asked to review and merge pull requests, external developers who are interested in submitting pull requests, and end-users who are interested in understanding the security model of OpenBazaar. We will also be including this threat model in our project documentation, but we are sharing on our blog first to solicit feedback from our users and security experts in the field. Every contributor with push access must read this document.

                    This week another darknet market closed abruptly. The Evolution site operators stole millions of dollars worth of users’ bitcoins. This is only the latest in a series of “exit scams” where the operators of these centralized markets will run legitimately for months, even years, and then run off with all the funds at once. When previous exit scams occurred, the proposed solution was implementing multisignature into the marketplaces. Users were told to only use marketplaces that offered multisig. This does make the users’ funds more secure – in theory. In practice, even though multisig was available in Evolution, it wasn’t widely used. People still trusted the centralized site operators with their Bitcoin.  Why would people still misplace their trust when this pattern has become obvious? One reason is that they are dealing with illegal items. Not all items on darknet markets are illegal, but a substantial portion are. They have no legal recourse if something goes wrong. This means they look for the most trusted site in operation, the one with the largest network of other users. As the number of users increases, so does the notoriety, publicity, and demands on the site infrastructure. With the increased stress and scrutiny on the system, the site operators have little margin for error. If something does go wrong, or the pressure becomes too intense, then those site operators will exit while they still can, taking down the entire system. Even in legal marketplaces, centralized systems share this flaw. The single point of control gives site operators the ability to determine the fate of the platform, and all its users. How can this be prevented? We’ve already mentioned multisig. Evolution implemented it, but did so in a way that was intended to still retain power over users’ funds. They required users to deposit funds with them, and then move them into the multisig later. A centralized site operator doesn’t want to give up their ability to extract fees from its users, so they don’t have a strong incentive to make multisig easy to use. Also, multisig might protect funds, but it doesn’t prevent the platform from shutting down altogether. The solution is to move away from the centralized systems completely. Removing the middleman will have enormous benefits for users. Consider the following benefits of decentralized markets:

                    Our team is exited to announce that the OpenBazaar project has been selected as one of Black Duck’s Open Source Rookies of the Year. Each year, Black Duck names ten new open source projects as their Rookies of the Year. Former winners include Bootstrap, Ansible, Docker, Tox, and many other amazing projects. We’re honored to be acknowledged alongside such great projects as well as the other rookies this year. We’d like to thank the community for their enthusiastic support of the project, as well as the dedicated group of volunteers who maintains the project. 2014 was a great beginning to the project, but 2015 will see OpenBazaar move out of beta and into a platform that can be used for free trade online, with Bitcoin, anywhere in the world. Let’s make trade free together.

                    We recently faced a minor security incident at the OpenBazaar GitHub repository. An attacker was able to briefly gain push access and make code changes that remained undetected for about one hour, by pretending to be a developer with contributor access who lost access to his normal account. The changes that the attacker made to the code were insignificant and were not related to security – they were mostly tests. Only the “develop” branch was affected, not the “master” branch. As our users run the “master” branch, we expect no users to be affected by this breach. We reverted the code changes immediately and access rights were restored. We don’t expect anyone to be affected by this attack. As a response to the attack, we are on the process of developing more rigorous security policies which would require proper authentication for committer username changes. Our new policies will also include operational security requirements for existing developers. In response to the attack and in coordination with GitHub, we have ensured that the accounts of the attacker have been appropriately banned. As part of our transparency commitment to our users, we are publishing this security incident so that people are aware of our potential problems and solutions. Our full incident response post-mortem report is made available for the community to read.

                    OpenBazaar is now almost eight months old. We’ve grown from myself to over 58 contributors over the life of the project, with a community response that has been overwhelming at times. One of the largest challenges of a project like this is building and maintaining a great team. Take an open source project, intentionally make it unfunded with no profit model, and now you have a much more difficult challenge. For the last eight months we have had little to no worries in this department as our core team has slowly grown. Unfortunately, that could not last forever. Since our team is contributing in their spare hours and have families, jobs, and other obligations, several particpants have had to reduce their contributions to the project. We recently announced an approach to move to a team-based development structure where individuals would be responsible for different aspects of the project. This was in response to the team growing quickly and myself and the core devs feeling like this would be a better way to manage everything going on. I wondered if this might be a little premature to do so, but it felt right considering the team we had put together. Now we have recently lost a few team members due to several factors and who will now be serving in a diminished capacity as they tend to their other responsibilities. This change means we need to refocus our efforts and be realistic about how the project will progress. To be clear, while the number of contributors has decreased, we still have a good team and we’re confident that we can deliver a full release in a reasonable amount of time. I’m making this post because we decided early on that the OpenBazaar project would be as transparent and honest with the community as possible, so when we have new developments we put that information out as soon as possible. I am currently working with the core devs to distill down our future plans into critical areas that need to get done. We will be simplifying and stepping back to ensure we tackle only the most necessary pieces of our software. The first priority is the p2p network. Our second priority is the trading protocol. Finally we will continue to improve the user interface and push towards the vision of a standalone app that works across all platforms. [caption id=”” align=”alignright” width=”340”] This train keeps rolling.[/caption] As we rolled out our current solution we have run into several issues around our infrastructure that’s in place. One critical decision we made was that in order to support Tor we stuck with TCP-based connections between peers using ZeroMQ. We have tried many different approaches, but it seems like using ZeroMQ in this p2p capacity may be a tough road ahead. We are currently investigating several other approaches including moving to UDP-based networking and leveraging proven libraries like libtorrent who have solved many of the connectivity problems we are experiencing, while still allowing use of Tor. This should be exciting and we hope this work will bear fruit soon. If you have any p2p networking experience and would like to help us tackle this problem please reach out. We’d love to have your help. Our next big focus area will be on the trading protocol, which we will be calling the OpenBazaar Marketplace Protocol (OBMP). There are many details of how this will work and what will be included, but we believe that by clearly defining the protocol and what is expected between nodes to communicate and peers to trade we will improve the stability and security of the network as a whole. More details to be released soon on this.
