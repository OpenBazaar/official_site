                    In these posts we take a look at some unique members of the OpenBazaar ecosystem. Today our featured shop is Bitcoin Not Bombs, another of our great community members that has been active from day 1! Read their story below and shop Bitcoin Not Bombs on OpenBazaar. Just want to browse? Check them out on Duosearch and at BitcoinNotBombs.com      Tell us a bit about yourself? My background is in media production but I don’t get to do much of that these days. In 2008 I became interested in economics and caught the silver bug and alternative currencies became a hobby of mine. When I first heard about Bitcoin in 2011 I was immediately intrigued. In 2012 I started selling silver dime cards on Bitmit.net and began working with Davi Barker on creating more products we could sell. In 2013 Davi and I took the Bitcoin Not Bombs product line to the first US Bitcoin conference in San Jose, we were blown away by the response. We knew this would be a great niche market but at that one event we sold out of almost everything we had. Back then people were buying products for bitcoin just to show support for the currency. I see a lot of that same excitement with OpenBazaar today. The Bitcoin Not Bombs logo has been printed on t-shirts, hoodies, lapel pins, patches, stickers, shot glasses and other small items over the last few years. We have also collaborated on a few large art projects like the world’s first coin operated voting machine. The brand and logo means different things to different people and we like it that way. These days we have reduced our inventory to only the small items sold on OpenBazaar and Purse.io. Many of Davi’s t-shirt designs can be found at store.bitcoin.com and a lot of our work goes to supporting antiwar efforts. Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? Because it matters, though I’m somewhat disappointed that less than 300 vendors are still actively selling items on the network. I know thousands more have downloaded the client and set up stores but lost interest. In the summer of ‘15 one of the OB developers asked us if we could list our small low risk items when the software became available. I was ready with our first listing on day one, a lapel pin that supports the FreeRoss.org campaign. In some ways OpenBazaar is the conclusion of the Silk Road experiment, I wanted people to see that connection and offer this lapel pin from the beginning. How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? Great! Things where buggy in the beginning but I was happy to ride that out, I saw the development team pushing updates constantly so I knew it would get better fast. Things run very smooth now and I still get a few orders a month, I suspect everyone will see a second wave of orders once version 2.0 is available. How familiar are you with Bitcoin? Fairly familiar, I’m not a programmer or computer expert but I have read a lot of technical information on how Bitcoin works. One reason I stuck with it was that I knew it would only be a few years before the wallets became extremely easy to use. At this point you don’t need to know how Bitcoin works under the hood to use it, but a better understanding of the technology will lead to more adoption. What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you? Not having a way to combined shipping cost on orders is my biggest complaint, but I have seen that a better shopping cart system will become available in version 2.0 along with variable data like size and color. Does your store have any special promotions? For Bitcoin Black Friday we will offer free US shipping and a free gift for international orders.

                    In these posts we take a look at some unique members of the OpenBazaar ecosystem. Today our featured shop is Cyberfunks Alliance’s event in Austin, TX called Bitcoin Awakens. This unique event is designed to help new users get oriented to acquiring and using Bitcoin through a fun and interactive game. You can find tickets to the event on OpenBazaar and learn more about their philanthropic mission by reading on! Tell us a bit about yourself? ob-cyberfunksalliance-store.png) and our aim is to create a broadly-based, widely-accessible, deeply-entrenched network of Urban, tech-savvy Bitcoin enthusiasts in Austin, TX! At Cyberfunks, we directly address the pain points for user adoption and appeal, such as user experience, price volatility, security, and use cases in the local community. Most Bitcoin conferences spend more time giving presentations and targeting those already in the bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem. Real engagement. Real use. Real value. An event where everyone leaves Bitcoin literate. Reframing Bitcoin as an immersive adventure will create the peak experiences necessary to shorten the adoption curve from early adopters to the early majority. What do you make or sell? We sell tickets to our event Bitcoin Awakens and provide a way for our partner, the Central Texas Food Bank, to accept donations to fight hunger in over 21 counties in Texas. “Bitcoin Awakens” Event Tickets on OpenBazaar Our inaugural event, Bitcoin Awakens, on Sunday, November 6th, 2016, 8AM - 8PM, at our headquarters, Urban Co-Lab in Austin, TX. Bitcoin literacy meets fun-filled adventures as players take center stage in a flood of competition, mystery, &amp; camaraderie—based on scenarios from the Star Wars Universe. Teams of three (3) will solve up to 15 challenges throughout the city of Austin, TX to reveal the coordinates of a secret location for a victory party in honor of the mysterious creator of the Bitcoin protocol. Selling tickets for crypto events is a no-brainer because the OpenBazaar audience spans worldwide. Eventbrite, Meetup, and other event websites only reach a portion of the world’s population. With OpenBazaar, we sell tickets internationally to anyone, anywhere. Donations to the Central Texas Food Bank We are introducing a new way for the community to support one of our partners, the Central Texas Food Bank, by donating bitcoin through our OpenBazaar store. Bitcoin provides a means to make donations transparent, and through OpenBazaar, we are reaching people worldwide. To make donations transparent, we use the Food Bank’s bitcoin address (1ARxKuBArW8XzJQNGoRC5RZBVqhb4Tx5yx) found on centraltexasfoodbank.org/bitcoin, and you can write off any donation made to the the Food Bank for tax purposes (optional, as anonymous donations are more than welcome!!!).          Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? ** The idea came to me after spending an absurd amount of time helping my mom donate to an organization. The amount of personal details and time required needed to make a simple donation was burdensome and unnecessary. The current donation model bombards people by stealing their time and attention, which is priceless, by inviting counterparty risk and friction to philanthropic campaigns, which removes a lot of incentive for people to give. OpenBazaar enables “zero-marginal-cost charities” with no interference with government regulation. It’s free to download and use. It’s permissionless, borderless, and available to anyone with a computer and internet connection. OpenBazaar removes many barriers that otherwise exist in banking and philanthropy. OpenBazaar donations can bring a lot of awareness to causes that need assistance while sending a message to the world about the viability of decentralized marketplace and microdonations. More stories about the “good” a decentralized application can do and the amount of people we can empower are the stories we plan to bring to the entire crypto ecosystem.   **How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? When I heard about OpenBazaar before the beta release, all I knew is I wanted to be involved. I joined the beta on day one and opened a luxury watch store with a friend from high school called Justin Time. I am not a watch guy, but my buddy, who the director of timepieces at a well-respected diamond company in Dallas, TX, has years of experience in the industry. We decided to partner, and before I knew it, I was spending all my time learning about OpenBazaar. It has been exciting to see OpenBazaar stores, listings, and community grow. The OpenBazaar Slack channel is an incredible resource for anyone to learn how to use OpenBazaar, regardless of eCommerce or technical experience. The OB1 crew work like robots and are extremely responsive to questions. Also, OB1 CEO, Brian Hoffman, was the first to donate to the Food Bank while newly hired OB1 developer, Tyler Smith, provides the server to host our store. It truly is a community that all projects in this space can learn from.   How familiar are you with Bitcoin? We aren’t Satoshi, but we live Bitcoin daily. No movies or T.V. series provides the amount of comedy, drama (forks), tragedy (hacks), or overall entertainment that the Bitcoin community does. We teach Bitcoin literacy through Bitcoin Awakens and host weekly Bitcoin Meetups every Monday in Austin, TX. You don’t need to know everything about Bitcoin &amp; blockchain technologies and there there are plenty of ways to familiarize yourself with the concepts and theory of it. But, we want to teach people how to take advantage of Bitcoin and show them how to apply it in their own lives. We want them to experience Bitcoin and give them the knowledge and power to build a better life for themselves and their family.   What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you? Most of the changes I look forward to will be implemented in version 2.0 (IPFS, Auctions, Inventory Management, statistics, etc.). However, I do have some suggestions:

                    Today we’ve released version 1.1.8, the first release in a few months. This release adds several new features for vendors as well as a significant amount of bug fixes and code improvements. You can download this new version on the openbazaar.org page. We’ve also created an installer which only contains the client for users who have a server hosted remotely (such as a VPS) and don’t need a local server installation. If you want to use the client-only installer, visit the Download page and choose the “Client Only” installer for your operating system.

                    Up in the northern hemisphere the long summer days are getting shorter and shorter. The leaves are turning and beginning to fall from the trees and the air smells like the coming cold – and we are so ready! There’s a lot to love about autumn and we wanted to highlight a few things from OpenBazaar shops to help you get in the spirit. Many of these items are offered at a special 10% discount through October as well – and a few shops even have their entire inventory on sale so make sure you click through and check them out this month while it lasts. There’s a lot more to this Autumn Sale than just these autumn items though, check out the tag #AutumnSale in OpenBazaar through October to see all the new merchandise being added!

                    In these posts we take a look at some unique members of the OpenBazaar ecosystem. Today our featured shop is Bitcoin Mitchell, the OpenBazaar outpost of one of our very active community members! You can find Bitcoin Mitchell on OpenBazaar, on Duosearch and at BitcoinInformation.info    Tell us a bit about yourself? I am Mitchell, a 22 year old IT professional with a Bachelor’s degree who is currently working as a backend developer. I’ve been into Bitcoin since 2013, but heard about it in 2012 from a friend of mine. I did look into it at the time, but downloading the Blockchain took me too long so I quit and never looked back until a year later. When I started with Bitcoin I was a standard newbie. I didn’t know much about Bitcoin and mostly visited faucets. After a while I found out about BitVegas (now defunct) and starting going there quite often. They had the highest paying faucet at that point in time, but I usually just spent it on the games they had. My favorites were the pig races and the roulette table. I got my first 3BTC from there as there was a discussion between two people and their point of argument was that rich people could help more than poor people because they had the resources to do so. Anyway, to prove their point someone started randomly gifting people Bitcoins. Lucky me! Around this time I started my own website named BitcoinInformation.info where I wanted to put some information about Bitcoin (I wrote it as BitCoin back then). With the Bitcoins I received I set up my first faucet, which also caused me to register my Bitcointalk account (now called Mitchell, instead of BitcoinInformation). I was the first one to offer both direct Bitcoin withdrawals and Peerbet withdrawals.

                    We are working on a product that will make setting up an OpenBazaar shop incredibly easy. This week we worked through fixing an issue that surfaced but it will be ready very soon, so if you or someone you know is ready to open an OpenBazaar shop but would like to keep it simple, keep an eye out for our launch!

                    Earlier this year I was invited to be a speaker and present OpenBazaar at this year’s Hacker’s Congress at Paralelní Polis (HCPP16) in Prague. I’ve never been to Prague, and hadn’t visited Paralelní Polis yet, so I was excited to attend. If you’re not familiar with Paralelní Polis, they’re an organization of hackers and artists in the Czech Republic who condemn authoritarian governments and use digital activism to make people more free. This year’s Hacker’s Congress described itself as having “hundreds of technology enthusiasts, tech-entrepreneurs, activists and cryptoanarchists to celebrate the age of digital freedom and decentralization!” You can’t miss the Paralelní Polis building in Prague; it’s completely black. The bottom floor is a coffee shop that only accepts Bitcoin, and the other floors were turned into rooms for presentations over the weekend.    I spoke on the last day about OpenBazaar. Here’s the summary of my talk:
