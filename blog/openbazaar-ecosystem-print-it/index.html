<meta name="description" content="In these posts we take a look at some unique members of the OpenBazaar ecosystem. Today we interview a vendor – Print It! – selling items that he 3d prints himself, as well as a 3d printing service. You can find his store on OpenBazaar at @print_it, and on Duosearch here. I’ve personally bought a few items from the Print It! shop, the most recent being an OpenBazaar tent, of which 50% of his profit he donates back to the project. [caption id=”attachment_1063” align=”aligncenter” width=”648”] OpenBazaar Tent from Print It! store[/caption] Tell us a bit about yourself? As many in our community I’m an inquisitive person and very excited about our culture and with it our technical evolution. I’m happy of being a part and a contemporary witness of this development where people get the chance to express their true nature and explore their full potential in a growing free society. What do you make / sell? In my eyes my main product is the 3D printing service. Everyone who invests some hours on tutorials about CAD software, will be surprised how easy it is to bring an abstract idea into a digital shape. The next logical step would be to convert that digital shape into an analog one. The digital step is free to go thanks to people who are developing amazingly complex, but easy to use CAD tools like Blender for example. The second step unfortunately isn’t free at all. If you’re not a designer who’s testing several prototypes, you’ll think more than twice about buying a 3D printer. Especially if you’re keen on highest quality and accuracy, and don’t want to be limited by a cheap printer, which only produces frustration. The other products in my shop have two main goals: To provide useful tools or gadgets and to help people getting in touch with 3D printing. They can also be seen as a demonstration of whats possible with such a diverse usable technique. Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? The steady and fast growing community of makers have shown that there is so much more potential in our society. More and more people are realizing that they can accomplish more than just following the mainstream by consuming products which are dictated by fancy advertisements. Everything can be improved forever, by everyone. It just needs someone who is curious enough to think around the corner. Openbazaar itself is a great example. When I first started modeling prototypes and finally got the chance to buy a high quality 3D printer, I asked myself, why not sharing this opportunity with everyone else who is interested in converting their ideas into real models or gadgets? [caption id=”attachment_1065” align=”aligncenter” width=”648”] Print It! OpenBazaar storefront[/caption] How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? When I used OpenBazaar the first time, I was amazed how professional everything looked and how easy it was to set up a simple but nicely designed shop. It’s more than obvious that the OB1 team did a really great job on it. And the best thing is that implementing and supporting a very social and equal structure is one of their main goals. It’s a great community in every way and just nice to help other people or receive help from others. How familiar are you with Bitcoin? I’m using Bitcoin since 2013 and realized very soon, that the best thing that can happen to a cryptocurrency is just being used as a currency. This whole speculation thing is not creating a real value. OpenBazaar hopefully will be a huge help for bitcoin to achieve its real purpose. What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more usefulfor you? The main steps to improve this already awesome app would be the implementation of IPFS and Tor. But as far as I know you’re already working on this. Although I sell legal stuff, I’d like to see the option to delete fulfilled orders or at least the addresses of buyers. When tor hopefully gets implemented this would be a very important thing to protect the privacy of buyers. Another thing would be a solution to the problem, that a lot of bitcoins get lost in escrow when the buyer forgets to finalize the order and the chosen mod isn’t reachable either. Maybe a deadline would be nice to release the funds, when there is no response from the buyer and the mod anymore. Another wish would be, that the step from OB 1.0 to OB 2.0 wont result in a “reset” of every shop in the aspect of followers and reviews. I think I speak for every vendor on OpenBazaar that good reviews and many followers are a result of hard work, in which case it would be a pity to loose them all. Anything else you’d like to say? I’d like to thank everyone in the community and OB-Team making all this possible whats just happening right now. Special thanks to @sampatt for being this careful and interested in everyone’s opinion!" />

I’m happy of being a part and a contemporary witness of this development where people get the chance to express their true nature and explore their full potential in a growing free society. <strong>What do you make / sell?</strong> In my eyes my main product is the 3D printing service. Everyone who invests some hours on tutorials about CAD software, will be surprised how easy it is to bring an abstract idea into a digital shape. The next logical step would be to convert that digital shape into an analog one. The digital step is free to go thanks to people who are developing amazingly complex, but easy to use CAD tools like Blender for example. The second step unfortunately isn’t free at all. If you’re not a designer who’s testing several prototypes, you’ll think more than twice about buying a 3D printer. Especially if you’re keen on highest quality and accuracy, and don’t want to be limited by a cheap printer, which only produces frustration. The other products in my shop have two main goals: To provide useful tools or gadgets and to help people getting in touch with 3D printing. They can also be seen as a demonstration of whats possible with such a diverse usable technique. <strong>Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar?</strong> The steady and fast growing community of makers have shown that there is so much more potential in our society. More and more people are realizing that they can accomplish more than just following the mainstream by consuming products which are dictated by fancy advertisements. Everything can be improved forever, by everyone. It just needs someone who is curious enough to think around the corner. Openbazaar itself is a great example. When I first started modeling prototypes and finally got the chance to buy a high quality 3D printer, I asked myself, why not sharing this opportunity with everyone else who is interested in converting their ideas into real models or gadgets?

It’s more than obvious that the OB1 team did a really great job on it. And the best thing is that implementing and supporting a very social and equal structure is one of their main goals. It’s a great community in every way and just nice to help other people or receive help from others. <strong>How familiar are you with Bitcoin?</strong> I’m using Bitcoin since 2013 and realized very soon, that the best thing that can happen to a cryptocurrency is just being used as a currency. This whole speculation thing is not creating a real value. OpenBazaar hopefully will be a huge help for bitcoin to achieve its real purpose. <strong>What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more usefulfor you?</strong> The main steps to improve this already awesome app would be the implementation of IPFS and Tor. But as far as I know you’re already working on this. Although I sell legal stuff, I’d like to see the option to delete fulfilled orders or at least the addresses of buyers. When tor hopefully gets implemented this would be a very important thing to protect the privacy of buyers. Another thing would be a solution to the problem, that a lot of bitcoins get lost in escrow when the buyer forgets to finalize the order and the chosen mod isn’t reachable either. Maybe a deadline would be nice to release the funds, when there is no response from the buyer and the mod anymore. Another wish would be, that the step from OB 1.0 to OB 2.0 wont result in a “reset” of every shop in the aspect of followers and reviews. I think I speak for every vendor on OpenBazaar that good reviews and many followers are a result of hard work, in which case it would be a pity to loose them all. <strong>Anything else you’d like to say?</strong> I’d like to thank everyone in the community and OB-Team making all this possible whats just happening right now. Special thanks to @sampatt for being this careful and interested in everyone’s opinion!</p>
