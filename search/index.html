Amir Taaki lead a small team of developers to build a proof of concept for a decentralized marketplace. The software was completely peer to peer with no central organization controlling it. The Dark Market entry won the hackathon, but Amir and his team decided not to continue work on the project.Brian Hoffman talked to Amir about Dark Market and learned they weren’t going to continue development. He liked the idea of a decentralized marketplace, but didn’t like the sole focus on darknet markets, so he forked the project and renamed it OpenBazaar.The idea of a permissionless marketplace was powerful, and people around the world joined Brian to help build this open source software. In September this team released the first test version of the software. Over the next few months the team continued improving the software and got an encouraging response from the Bitcoin community. They visited FOSSDEM (Free Open Source Software Developers European Meeting) in Brussels early in 2015, and presented the project to an enthusiastic crowd. Brian and a few core members of the team decided that it was time to turn the project from a part-time, volunteer effort into a serious, well-funded campaign to bring free trade to the world.They founded a company, OB1, with a $1 million venture capital investment from Union Square Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz, and immediately began hiring developers to build a better version of the software from the ground up.In April 2016 the first full release of the software was published, and tens of thousands of people around the world downloaded OpenBazaar and began buying and selling with each other directly, using Bitcoin.OB1 received a second round of investment for $3 million in the fall of 2016, further expanding their development team and began work on the second major version of the software, improving on the limitations of the first version.",

                    "content": "These are our guidelines for being a successful moderator on the OpenBazaar network.1. Moderators must be responsiveThe biggest problem users have with moderators is when they are unresponsive. If a moderator is chosen for a dispute, and then is unresponsive, the transaction is stuck and both parties will be angry. If you are a moderator on the network you must not abandon your users. If you choose to no longer offer your services, you can remove yourself as a moderator in settings.2. Moderators must be responsiveSeriously, this is so important that’s it’s #1 and #2. You need to respond quickly when a dispute is open. It’s crucial that moderators never go unresponsive.3. Moderators need to do their best to contact both parties involvedModerators should set up their own rules to determine how long they’ll wait before settling a dispute. Only giving a day or two to respond isn’t long enough, but if you wait a month that’s probably too long. You must make a good faith effort to contact both parties to get their side of the story before resolving a dispute. Make sure to look for alternative contact information on their page instead of just using the built-in chat.4. Moderators need to be unbiasedYou need to resolve disputes based on the information provided by both parties. If you can’t provide professional, unbiased dispute resolution, please don’t become a moderator.5. Moderators need to resolve disputes quickly and understand how the timeout worksBitcoin prices are volatile, and the longer you take the more likely your customers will lose patience. Ensure that you’ve contacted both parties and gotten the information needed, but once you have, make sure to resolve as soon as possible.If funds stay in the escrow for approximately 45 days, they will then be automatically released to the vendor. This “timeout” feature is included to prevent funds from being stuck in case parties become unresponsive. It also means that unscrupulous vendors can play the waiting game and receive the funds even if they didn’t deliver the product. Moderators must be aware of when funds will automatically release in order to prevent a vendor from receiving the funds if they don’t deserve them.6. Moderators should be clear about their own termsIf you refuse to moderate certain transactions, or only moderate for certain size transactions, or only in certain jurisdictions – or whatever your terms are – make sure to spell these out in the “Terms” section in moderator settings. This will reduce the number of cases people open that you won’t take because they violate your terms.There are lots of examples of moderators setting their own terms. You can follow these links to see examples:  OB Central Moderation Agreement  @Serp Moderation  Lunokhod ModerationIf you need a refresher on how moderated payments work in OpenBazaar, you can read the section below.How Moderated Payments WorkOpenBazaar uses 2-of-3 multisig addresses for moderated payments. When a buyer wants to purchase a listing, instead of sending the funds directly to the seller, he will send the funds to the multisig account. The three people who control this account are the buyer, the seller, and a trusted third party selected beforehand. We call these trusted third parties ‘moderators’.Now there are five possible ways for the funds to be released from the multisig address:      The seller sends the product or delivers the service and the buyer is satisfied. The buyer and seller are the two of three parties needed for the multisig, and together they release the funds to the seller. This is what a normal transaction will look like.        The seller cannot deliver the listing as promised or the buyer is unhappy with the listing, and they mutually agree to refund the buyer. Again, the buyer and seller are the two of three parties needed for the multisig. This time they join together and release the funds to the buyer.        The buyer and seller are in a dispute and cannot agree how to release funds. The moderator comes in and decides that the seller is at fault. The moderator then joins with the buyer to release a refund to the buyer.        The buyer and seller are in a dispute and cannot agree how to release funds. The moderator comes in and decides that the buyer is at fault. The moderator then joins with the seller and releases the funds to the seller.        The buyer and seller are in a dispute and cannot agree how to release funds. The moderator comes in and decides that neither or both parties are at fault, and the moderator joins with either party to release funds in a split between buyer and seller.  In this fashion fraud is prevented by only allowing funds to be sent to the seller or refunded to buyer when either 1) buyer and seller mutually agree or 2) an independent third party decides which party is at fault and joins with the winning party to release funds.",

                    "content": "NEWS: The developers of OpenBazaar have released a service to help prevent scams from occurring within the OpenBazaar application called Verified Moderators. This feature displays which moderators have been vetted by OB1 and ultimately provide a greater level of comfort when transacting in OpenBazaar (shown above).OpenBazaar is a decentralized, free and open-source network for trading goods and services directly and privately between people. It is made up of users running the software on their computers all over the world which allows for great opportunities but also requires a high level of responsibility from each user.Here are 5 suggestions to avoid potential scams on OpenBazaar:  Simply choosing a moderated payment doesn’t protect you; only choosing a reputable moderator protects you. If you don’t recognize any of the moderators a vendor offers, it’s best to take some time to reach out to them or purchase from a different vendor. Prefer verified moderators over unverified.  Vendors should offer multiple moderators for buyers to choose from. If the vendor offers only one moderator and they are unknown to you, they might be attempting to scam you.  Always use moderated payments (choose a moderator at checkout) for large transactions unless you completely trust the vendor. There is no way to open a dispute if you sent the funds directly.  If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Most reported scams are for large value items like cryptocurrency miners that were offered at a steep discount.  OpenBazaar has no company or organization in control of the platform that can control, interfere with, or even see a user’s transactions. There is no one capable of refunding your money if you are scammed.If you feel you may have been scammed, please report the vendor and/or moderator on the scammer Reddit thread. We apologize for the inconvenience and are working hard to release the Verified Moderators feature as fast as we can. Until then, please be careful with each transaction you make.",

Wondered why I wasn’t continuing to get that flood of new users :-)[10:15] 🌪 mg (ob1): You’re welcome. ;)[10:15] 🌪 mg (ob1): You’re welcome?[10:15] Impartial Moderation: Yes![10:15] 🌪 mg (ob1): ![10:16] 🌪 mg (ob1): Rod, I think that’s very doable. I’ll share the suggestion.[10:17] rod: Something like all IPNS keys + their records. I am going to do a full rewrite of RawFlood and it would be amazing to be able to not have to individually resolve every IPNS record (or at least most of them)[10:17] rod: Sweet, thanks Mike[10:22] 🌪 mg (ob1): It would be nice to see the IPNS ingestion work become part of the formal search spec, so that the search provider that has been opted-into will begin to receive that node’s IPNS updates as part of the publish… it doesn’t quite handle the part of the network who hasn’t opted-into the provider.[10:23] Impartial Moderation: OB web implementation… will it work like a normal node? Buyers only?[10:24] rod: @mg If there is a formal spec that’s eventually written up, I would be happy to integrate it[10:25] Impartial Moderation: Thanks all :-)[10:25] 🌪 mg (ob1): Unsure if this will be part of  the existing search provider spec or a separate one. Please follow up later. :)[10:25] rod: Will do[10:37] Leonardo José: Ty[10:37] rod: Thanks Sam[10:37] Impartial Moderation: Have a nice day all :-)[10:37] Sam - OB1: Thank you! Bye!",

                "content": "This year has been an exciting time in the cryptocurrency space. Many projects are taking deeper root and putting out applications that are more practical and easy to use to enable people to do more with the coins they love. They’re making exciting strides getting the power of (notoriously hard-to-use!) decentralized networks into people’s hands. The OpenBazaar community has seen a surge of great activity lately too doing just the same!Here are some of the biggest things going on in the OpenBazaar community this summer:      The Haven release is imminent! Haven is the first full-featured mobile app for using the OpenBazaar network. It is being developed by OB1, the company leading the development of the open-source OpenBazaar protocol. It has an exciting new social posting feature and makes it incredibly easy to shop, sell and chat privately on the OpenBazaar network from your iOS or Android device. Haven is wrapping up its testing phase now and will be launching very soon. To be the first to know when it’s live, get on the waitlist at gethaven.app        Zokos is a new service that helps you set up your store on OpenBazaar in less than a minute in your browser for free. This tool makes it easy for you to manage your store on the web rather than through the desktop application and offers some features to make your store management more convenient.        For anyone interested in developing their own search engine for OpenBazaar, the same party that produced Zokos also open-sourced their search engine code, called Rawflood.        A community member has worked up a proof of concept for Monero integration into OpenBazaar.        A couple of the core developers of OpenBazaar attended IPFS Camp earlier this month to connect with the team deveopling IPFS and other projects that are using the protocol like OpenBazaar. Here’s a recap of the event from the IPFS team.  Want More?Get more information about these projects and other topics in the development space from the latest OpenBazaar Developer Call:    ",

Woot[10:24] 🌪 mg (ob1): Providing Reliable Messaging in OpenBazaar: https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-go/issues/1442[10:25] ASCiiDiTY: The crypto listing feature is great. I’ve made a few trades very fast. The issue I’ve had though is it lets buyers pay for more coin than is in inventory. I had to cancel a trade because of this.[10:25] Rod: Thanks Sam  :p[10:28] Rod: Since becoming a moderator we’ve seen two cases where buyers were unable to send offline messages/write to the DHT. Would Chris’s work with the webrelay code be helpful at all for delivering messages for client users?[10:28] Jimmy Jam: Search feature seems finicky. Looking for a certain user or item doesn’t always get the desired result.[10:28] Jimmy Jam: But I love the project overall.[10:28] ASCiiDiTY: I got trades very fast, that was why I was so impressed. I did list at -0.5% market price though.[10:29] Jimmy Jam: AsciiDiTy - what do you sell?[10:29] ASCiiDiTY: CBD isolate.[10:29] Jimmy Jam: ah, nice[10:29] ASCiiDiTY: I do sell hemp flower as well but it’s not listed on my OB store.[10:30] ASCiiDiTY: You can find my main website by searching “CBDwire”.[10:30] Jimmy Jam: if I type in CBD will I find it easily - some of the people I speak to told me that they’ve had difficulty finding what they’re looking for on openbazaar[10:30] ASCiiDiTY: Yes you should be able to find it easily in OB search[10:32] Tim Felsky: Have been speaking with another OpenBazaar user about bringing forward some media in the form of a podcast related to D-Commerce. Still early in the discussion but invite you to connect if you’d like to share or participate![10:32] Impartial Mod: How do you check which listings are legal?[10:33] uzuz: Any plans or roadmap for v3 onions support or generally Tor easy setup, like one click setup or clearnet shop versus onion shop and everything else goes by itself easily even for nontech anonymity people? Also is there any plan to add different admin levels/permissions. Sometimes I would need someone else to take care of some tasks, but without need to give the guy full access to ne shop. Would be nice.[10:34] Matt: Any plans to create a way to do search in an uncensorable way by default? Or a 1 click way to do that, without having to rely on 3rd party search provider?[10:34] ASCiiDiTY: I’ve noticed people selling illegal drugs are just following hundreds of users so they appear in followed by tab of my store.[10:35] 🌪 mg (ob1): Embedded Tor: https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-go/pull/1515[10:35] 🌪 mg (ob1): Matt, would that be something like a self-initiated crawl?[10:37] Rod: https://github.com/OpenBazaar/obips/blob/master/obip-0003.mediawiki[10:37] Matt: sure, or easy way to create a search server that only you could use, or share[10:39] Matt: bascially, or something functionally the same[10:39] Rod: https://github.com/rodkeys/rawflood[10:39] 🌪 mg (ob1): Thanks Rod…beat me by seconds. :P[10:40] Rod: https://zokos.com/blog/site/public/2019/04/04/RawFlood%20setup%20instructions/[10:41] uzuz: Thank you for the v3 or tor support out of the box.

You do not need to. OpenBazaar supports sending messages to an offline node for them to retrieve later.[10:42] raz: tks[10:42] 🌪 mg (ob1): (As long as the node comes online to check the DHT for these messages at least every 7 days…as they expire then)[10:43] 🌪 mg (ob1): ((If you do this…it usually takes 20-30 minutes to crawl the DHT looking for their messages, so be sure to run it for a bit…not just on and off.))[10:43] uzuz: Once tor easy will be there in OB the community will sure make effort to port it also to secure OSes.[10:43] 🌪 mg (ob1): usually = it could take as much as depending on how connected your node is.[10:44] raz: If I change my ip becase of vpn does it messup anything[10:44] raz: ok tks[10:45] 🌪 mg (ob1): https://openbazaar.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002761932-Why-am-I-not-seeing-messages-in-real-time-[10:45] uzuz: Tor or i2p :)[10:46] uzuz: Thanks 😎[10:47] Impartial Mod: Thanks :-)[10:47] 🌪 mg (ob1): Thanks for joining all![10:47] uzuz: 👏[10:47] Rod: Thanks Sam[10:47] Jimmy Jam: Merci[10:47] rbrunner7: Thanks[10:47] Sam - OB1: Thank you Rod",

                "content": "OpenBazaar 2.3.3 released today. This is a minor release, but delivers substantial improvements to the user experience, such as rapid loading of listings from search.We recommend that you backup your OpenBazaar data before you update.    Release Notes - ClientImprovements  Listings in the Discover page and user’s stores are now loaded by IPFS hash as well as IPNS lookup. In most cases this will cause the listing to load very quickly from IPFS. When the IPNS listing loads, if it is different from the IPFS data it will replace it.  When using the OB1 search provider, a category-based experience will be provided as a default. This more closely matches the experience on openbazaar.com. Other providers will use a normal search experience, as we can’t be sure if they would supply the same data in the same format needed for the OB1 design.  When using a search provider that does not provide Tor endpoints, the search calls will use the provider’s non-Tor endpoints instead. This is still secure, as traffic is still routed through Tor. Tor endpoints are used by some search provider’s to get around issues with CDNs like Cloudflare.  The app is now using Electron version 4.1.3.  The block explorers have been updated to more privacy-focused websites.Bug Fixes  A layout issue with some buttons was corrected.  Conditions on listings were not being shown due to a typo, they are now working.  An issue that caused the default image to sometimes not load in avatars with no data was fixed.Release Notes - ServerThe focus of this release is updating underlying go-ipfs to v0.4.19 and improving IPNS resolution. Notable to this release are the AutoNAT and AutoRelay features (which are disabled by default, but a necessary component for connectivity for mobile and clients which are unreachable via inbound connection (which are typical in NAT scenarios). Additionally, IPNS resolution (the process which converts the peer ID to the most-recently-updated “content root” for that peer) is now improved with the addition of OB1-provided infrastructure.In addition to this release, the multiwallet API /wallet/spend endpoint now supports a “sweep wallet” behavior that allows the wallet to be emptied without clever math from the user.Enhancements  Rebase onto IPFS v0.4.19  Added Method check for HEAD to validate undefined endpoint  Add spend all functionality to wallets  Improve multiwallet logging; Failure handling  Add EnableAutoRelay/EnableAutoNAT options to config  Add API router functionalityRefactoring  Remove stubbed subcommands Stop and RestartTesting  Update go for internal testing/building to v1.11Bug Fixes  Fix unhandled error in sign methods  Fix IPFS protocol identifier handling  Proper network lookup fixDocumentation  Add a blurb about min Golang version in READMEInternationalizationWe are actively translating the text in the OpenBazaar reference client.

                "title": "How to Sell Services for Cryptocurrency on OpenBazaar", 
                "content": "Making sales is about more than just moving physical products. People also make entire careers—and often very high level careers!—out of selling the services they perform. These can be things done from anywhere in the world like like web design, software development and copywriting, or very local things like medical assistance, legal representation and lawn care.In fact, services make up almost 70% of value added to the world’s economy. This kind of market share shows an enormous opportunity!Sell Your Services OnlineOpenBazaar’s unique approach to an escrow account makes it easy for a provider to list and bill for their services. By setting up a moderated transaction a service seller can be sure that their client has the funds for contract they are agreeing to and upon successful completion of the work the funds can simply be released to the seller.On OpenBazaar you can easily sell services for cryptocurrency. Here’s how.1. Define your serviceWhat services do you sell? How do you usually price them? Many providers offer services by the hour or on a custom basis, but to list services for sale on OpenBazaar it’s easiest to start by “productizing” them, or structuring them to be constrained to a set cost. For example, if you provide language translation services you may create 3 different products with different prices. For example:  100 - 200 words translated  200 - 400 words translated  400 - 600 words translated2. Create your listingsOnce you have your services defined you can create listings for them on OpenBazaar. Create a new listing and under Type, select “Service.”Give it a great title and description that relates to keywords people may use in search that will help them find it easily. Make sure to describe exactly what a buyer will receive and consider adding more information such as examples of past work or testimonials to make the offer compelling.Include at least 1 great image that describes your service such as a photo of you providing the service or an photo of the completed service with simple text overlaid, such as “500-700 Words Translated English to Chinese.”Tags can be added to boost the searchability of your item. Include obvious ones that relate to the item itself like “website design” or “manuscript editing,” then more as relates to broader categories it represents such as “business or “writing.”A category is to help keep your store organized. If you plan to sell both “software development” and “language translation,” you’d just type in the appropriate category for the appropriate listing.Variants and inventory can likely be left blank. These are helpful for things like physical goods where you may offer the exact same shirt but in 3 different colors and you only have a certain number of each. If you have variations with your services it is generally a good approach to create separate listings for each.With the return policy you can set this up however you’d like. You may want to say no refunds or perhaps offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee with a full refund option.Terms &amp; conditions can be added if you have any conditions or advisories you want to make people aware of when accessing or using your digital good.Select the coins you’d like to receive as payment: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and/or Zcash. it can be just one of them or any combination.3. Share your services from OpenBazaar.comOpenBazaar is a marketplace where people can browse and discover the items that you have for sale—but that’s not the only way they can find them!

If you think of questions, feel free to post them here and we’ll get them answered. :)[10:07] DiarioBitcoin.com: are the relay servers custom relay servers for the OB protocol, or are they generic protocol agnostic relay servers (TURN)?[10:10]  mg (ob1): The relay servers are specific to IPFS but are transport agnostic.[10:10]  mg (ob1): They were designed to ensure that if one transport were blocked, the IPFS relay could bridge across transports as needed.[10:11]  mg (ob1): More information: https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/examples/circuit-relaying[10:11] DiarioBitcoin.com: thanks![10:11] DiarioBitcoin.com: Q: when DAI support?[10:12]  mg (ob1): We’ll get that one at the end. :)[10:15]  mg (ob1): Thanks :) https://github.com/OpenBazaar/samulator[10:20] Matt: what platform will tokens be based on?[10:20]  mg (ob1): ERC-20[10:20] Matt: you should consider https://github.com/Bitcoin-com/slp-sdk[10:21]  mg (ob1): We might depending on our initial token success.

                "content": "IMPORTANT: This is a required updateWe have tweaked how pricing is calculated to be better aware of currency conversions and changed how content is cached/retrieved as part of the IPFS update. Old nodes and new nodes will be unable to share content. We recommend that you backup your OpenBazaar data before you update.OpenBazaar version 2.3.1 has been released and was primarily focused on upgrading the underlying IPFS library to 0.4.18. This release prepares the development team to enable some features which will improve message deliverability and discovery on the network. In addition to the IPFS update, we have several minor fixes and improvements which resolve some painful timing bugs and general code improvements and reorganizations.Release NotesThis is a minor release, focused on an IPFS rebase in the go server. It is important to back up your store before running this update.This release uses version 0.13.1 of the openbazaar-go server. You can view server changes at this link:https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-go/releases/tag/v0.13.1New Features  A bulk coin accepted updater control was added in settings/store. This allows a seller to update all the coins accepted by all their listings at the same time.Improvements  Blockbooth was removed from the list of default search providers.  Improvements were made in how moderators are loaded in the purchase screen, so the spinner doesn’t continue forever if one of them fails to load.  Code was added to handle upcoming changes to the peerID format.  A few changes were made to the metrics collected.  Some code clean up.  When coping a contract in the order details screen, the JSON is now formatted nicely.  Inputs are sanitized, to prevent any issues with a user entering invalid or harmful characters.Bug Fixes  An adjustment was made to prevent security software from incorrectly flagging the OB update as malware.  A bug that caused the dispute resolve button to not appear in disputes using ZCash was fixed.  If the url is missing a protocol in the fulfillment of a digital order, it will now open correctly.  An issue where the user page wouldn’t update the user’s name if it was changed was corrected.  A bug with the warning about external links showing when using Tor was fixed.  Minor fixes.InternationalizationWe are actively translating the text in the OpenBazaar reference client. If you are interested in volunteering as a translator, you can sign up at https://www.transifex.com/ob1/openbazaarSpecial ThanksA special thank you goes out to the many volunteers that provide translations, and to our testers that discovered important issues.For more development details, please see the release notes on Github.",

                "title": "How to Sell Digital Goods for Cryptocurrency on OpenBazaar", 
                "content": "When you think about the world’s largest internet marketplaces, what kind of products do you picture? Maybe you get your coffee or toilet paper or other daily sundries from Amazon or Alibaba. Maybe you buy secondhand or hard-to-find collectible items on Ebay. Maybe you visit Etsy for thoughtful handmade gifts. These sites do have a focus on physical goods but that’s not all they can do.This may blow your mind so proceed with caution.Where do you buy your ebooks? Okay, maybe still Amazon or similar… What about music and movies? Oh, now we’re starting to get a little weird. What about online courses? Digital access codes? Video game codes? Data bundles like fonts or photo editing presets?Online marketplaces aren’t all about physical goods. Digital goods are just as sellable as physical goods and there are many places where many people buy and sell them around the web.On OpenBazaar you can easily sell digital goods for cryptocurrency. Here’s how.1. File HostingFile hosting and automatic delivery within OpenBazaar is a features we plan to build in the future but they are still on ice at the moment. In the meantime, if you are selling things like game codes or gift cards, you will have to send them manually to your buyers when you receive a payment. If you are selling a file that users will need to download, you will need to host it somewhere.We would love to recommend a decentralized file hosting solution but the most promising projects are still in an early release stage or pre-release. If you’d like to learn more about projects like Filecoin, Storj and Sia you can do so here and here.You can host files somewhere like your own external website or server, or by using a storage service like Dropbox or Google Drive. Dropbox Professional and Business plans are paid services but they allow you to set a password on files for an extra layer of security around who can access it.When you receive a payment you can then share a link with your buyer that they can click to download their file. Or, if you want to keep it very simple and your file is small enough you can let buyers know that they need to provide an email address so you can email the file to them when their payment is confirmed.2. Create Your ListingNow that you have a plan for hosting and sharing your digital product you can create a listing for it on OpenBazaar. Create a new listing and under Type select “Digital Good.”Give it a great title and description that relate to keywords people may use in search to find it easily. Make sure to also describe how you will send the file to users when they complete their purchase and let them if you need something from them such as an email address. It’s also helpful to include any instructions they may need for setting up or installing your file if it requires that.Include at least 1 great image that describes your item such as a book jacket mockup for an ebook or the cover art for a music album.Tags can be added to boost the searchability of your item. Include obvious ones as relate to the item itself like “book” or “music” then more as relates to broader categories it represents such as “fiction” or “bluegrass.”A category helps keep your store organized. If you plan to sell both ebooks AND music albums, you’d just type in the corresponding category for each of your listings.Variants and inventory can likely be left blank. These are helpful for things like physical goods where you may offer the same hat but in 3 different colors with only a certian number of each available. If you have variations of your digital goods it may be worth creating separate listings for each.With the return policy you can set this up however you’d like. You may want to say no refunds if the price point is very low on the item or perhaps offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee with a full refund option.Terms &amp; conditions can be added if you have any conditions or advisories you want to make people aware of when accessing or using your digital good.Select the coins you’d like to receive as payment–it can be just one of them or any combination.3. Share your item from OpenBazaar.comOpenBazaar is a marketplace where people can browse and discover the items that you have for sale—but that’s not the only way they can find them! OpenBazaar.com exists to make it easy for you and others to share stores and listings to your social media and other communities.Once your listing is live you can click “View on web” in the address bar at the top to see it and share it.More Than a MarketplaceThe software is still new and it is very niche because it exclusively uses cryptocurrency for payments. It needs every true believer’s help to grow into a phenomenon worldwide and that starts with our community.

                "title": "How to Spend Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies on OpenBazaar", 
                "content": "Shopping online is pretty excellent, right? It’s really one of the most powerful features of the internet today. How great is it that we can connect to businesses around the world from just about anywhere we are and have things delivered right to us?But we now know there are some big downsides, too. What about all those extra fees to cover things like platform costs and payment processing? All of your private data like your address and financial information is stored on these networks which is a big risk to you if it ever gets hacked. Everything you do on these networks is spied on. Then you get ads from the spies so they can try to take more of your money!OpenBazaar helps people shop online but with a couple of very important differences:The OpenBazaar Network Is Made of People.OpenBazaar is decentralized which means the whole network is made up of just the computers that run the software and, of course, the people who own them. There are no big companies jacking up fees, taking a cut, pumping you full of ads, or deciding what you get to see.OpenBazaar Uses Cryptocurrencies for Payments.This means people anywhere in the world can buy and sell things with each other and not worry about added costs for platform use, crazy transaction fees or exchange rates for international currencies. If you want to buy something from someone in another country… you can! Cryptocurrencies work everywhere.Shopping with cryptocurrency works a little differently than with cash or credit cards but our mission with OpenBazaar is to make it easy. Here are four other features that you need to know about when you spend Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on OpenBazaar:1. Multiwallet for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Zcash and LitecoinOpenBazaar now has a multiwallet built right into it. This means you can use your choice of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Zcash and/or Litecoin (with Ether and others coming soon) right inside the application. Vendors can accept all of these coins by default as well and many of them choose to so you can shop with your favorites.2. Different Payment Types to Help Protect your CoinsHow do you keep your cryptocoins safe on a marketplace where there is no centralized company to insure your purchase and send you a refund in the event you’re unhappy? With futuristic innovation and good old fashioned people power, that’s how.OpenBazaar offers 2 major payment types: direct and moderated.A direct payment is when you send your coins directly to the seller to start your transaction. This is like handing someone cash but over the internet. Once you hand over the money there’s no way to get it back, unless the seller chooses to give you a refund. Be cautious!A moderated payment is when you send your coins to a 2-of-3 multisignature account that includes you, the seller and a moderator. A moderator is just another user on the network who has offered their moderation services to help in the case of a dispute. This like using an escrow service because 2 of the 3 parties involved in the transaction must agree for the coins to be released. Generally the buyer and seller agree but in the case of trouble with the transaction, either one of them can reach out to the moderator for help. Learn more about the details of payment types here.3. Moderator Types to Make Choosing a Moderator EasierAnyone can become a moderator on OpenBazaar so it’s very important to choose someone who is trustworthy. You may notice that some listings have an orange shield on them which signals that the seller has one or more OB1 Verified Moderators to choose from. An OB1 Verified Moderator has submitted some reputation &amp; identity information to OB1, the company leading the development of OpenBazaar, to demonstrate they are more likely to be trustworthy.If a seller does not have moderators or OB1 Verified Moderators listed on their item but you would like to use one on your transaction, just message the seller to request it. If they decline, proceed with caution unless you know and trust them and are willing to risk your coins.4. Different Listing Types So You Can Easily Search for Items, Services, Digital Goods and CryptocurrenciesWe often use the word “thing” to describe what’s for sale on OpenBazaar but did you know that people can also sell things that are not just physical things? Since its inception OpenBazaar users have listed “things” you may think of right away like books, clothing and art, but also “things” like real estate, internet hosting space and temporary rentals…the last two of which start to blur the line between “thing” and “service.”Services are also a distinct listing type available in OpenBazaar. People have listed translation, design, coding or other business services. Even ridesharing! (Wait, is that also on the blurry line of service/thing too?)Another listing type available is digital goods like ebooks, music, stock photos, game codes, gift cards and more. These items are particularly popular because they don’t require anyone to wrestle with the sometimes complicated logistics of shipping physical items. Digital goods also don’t require you to share your identity with the other party. You can buy and sell as many digital items as you like without ever sharing your identity information.The final listing type available right now is cryptocurrencies. Yes, they are digital goods too, but they’re distinct enough to merit a separate listing type. You can trade over 1,500 cryptocurrencies right in OpenBazaar. Just look around for the coins you want, select a listing, set your quantity from a seller’s available inventory, and pay for them with BTC, BCH, ZEC or LTC. The seller will then send them to your wallet and you can complete the transaction!Want To Learn More about Shopping with Cryptocurrencies on OpenBazaar?\\Check out these other posts that will help you get started:The Beginner’s Guide to Buying Goods, Services and Cryptocurrency on OpenBazaar3 Things That Make It Really Easy to Shop on OpenBazaar",

I’m a little unclear on that.[10:20] chris.troutner: Very cool.

                "content": "The shift to peer-to-peer online commerce won’t happen overnight. Until this technology becomes widespread, we need tools that help the transition go more smoothly.Some of the earliest feedback we heard from ecommerce sellers who were interested in OpenBazaar was that they wanted a way to easily share their store and listings on their social networks. To answer this we built OpenBazaar.com.A regular website to look into a decentralized networkOpenBazaar is an application that users have to download and run on their own computers to connect to and participate in the network. It is built this way to make the decentralization of the network possible. While the tech isn’t available for a full OpenBazaar buying &amp; selling experience in a browser yet, that doesn’t mean there can’t be just a simple website that looks into the marketplace.That solved the simplest part of the problem: sellers wanted to share their links easily and potential buyers—who may or may not know about OpenBazaar yet—wanted to view them in a predictable way.We launched OpenBazaar.com in the middle of last year and it’s been a hit. Traffic to the site is growing around 40% month over month. This shows us that users are interested in decentralized applications that uphold some core values, but that are also accessible wherever they may be in their technological adventures.Sharing store &amp; listings from within OpenBazaarPeople who want to share stores and listings easily on the web can grab their links from OpenBazaar.com several ways:  By clicking the green “View on Web” link in the address bar within their OpenBazaar client:  By copying the store ID and pasting it on the end of https://openbazaar.com/store/ like this:https://openbazaar.com/store/QmcUDmZK8PsPYWw5FRHKNZFjszm2K6e68BQSTpnJYUsML7Sharing store &amp; listings from OpenBazaar.comOn OpenBazaar.com there are additional features including these social share buttons:There is also the widget for sellers who have websites where they want to showcase their OpenBazaar store. Simply copy the code and add it to your site wherever you can post an embed or add HTML.We are working to build a fully decentralized marketplace and social experience to promote privacy and autonomy for users around the world. It’s clear to us, though, that the road to full decentralization is made up of multiple decentralized steps rather than a complete jump.Moving from centralized systems we are displeased with is a process that will take some time and the ability to make small advances through that process is imperative. Building decentralized apps that also interface with centralized apps that people are used to using right now is important to help them better match their desires for the future with their present reality.",

                "title": "Which Cryptocurrencies are used in OpenBazaar, and Why?", 
                "content": "The decentralized marketplace OpenBazaar supports several different cryptocurrencies for buying and selling goods and services between users. This post explains which currencies, and why were they chosen.Cryptocurrencies Supported in OpenBazaar  Bitcoin  Bitcoin Cash  Litecoin  ZcashWhy we Support these CryptocurrenciesOpenBazaar was originally developed with only Bitcoin in mind. At the beginning of 2018 we introduced a handful of new coins, and in early 2019 version 2.3 was released which added Litecoin and a new wallet which supports multiple coins per instance, which made it easier to integrate new coins moving forward.Because of the original reliance on Bitcoin, it’s always been a requirement for any supported cryptocurrency to be architecturally similar to Bitcoin for it to work properly. All the coins supported are forks of Bitcoin, unless otherwise noted.Another requirement is multisig. OpenBazaar uses multisig for moderated and offline payments (escrow), and coins must have this feature - or the ability to support escrow payments another way - to be supported.BitcoinBitcoin is the original cryptocurrency. It is the most secure, with a large industry of miners devoting energy to securing the blockchain. It has the most users of any cryptocurrency, and is used for commerce more frequently.Bitcoin was the only currency used in OpenBazaar from the beginning of the project in 2014 until early 2018. It is the most used cryptocurrency within the platform by a wide margin.Bitcoin CashBitcoin Cash was forked from Bitcoin in August 2017. The creators of Bitcoin Cash disagreed with the development decisions of Bitcoin (particularly around scaling), and created new consensus rules. They focus on their cryptocurrency being usable for commerce on-chain.OpenBazaar adopted Bitcoin Cash because adoption was technically simple due to its similarity to Bitcoin, and because community members were willing to offer support for the implementation.LitecoinLitecoin was one of the earliest altcoins. It is very similar to Bitcoin in design, with a few differences such as having a quicker block generation time and different hash algorithm.As one of the oldest altcoins it has well-established industry support, and a substantial community of users.Just like Bitcoin Cash, OpenBazaar adopted Litecoin because adoption was technically simple due to its similarity to Bitcoin, and because community members were willing to offer support for the implementation.ZcashZcash is a cryptocurrency that focuses on privacy. It was forked from Bitcoin, but adds the ability to do “shielded transactions” using zk-SNARKs, which aren’t traceable on the blockchain like typical Bitcoin transactions.Within OpenBazaar at the moment, shielded transactions using Zcash aren’t possible, and only transparent transactions (which aren’t private) are possible. At some point we hope to change that.As with the other currencies mentioned,  OpenBazaar adopted Zcash because adoption was technically simple due to its similarity to Bitcoin, and because community members were willing to offer support for the implementation.Other cryptocurrenciesEthereum support is being actively developed now.Some ERC-20 tokens will also be supported after Ethereum support is added.There is discussion about Monero support, but because of Monero’s multisig design it might only allow direct transactions, not escrowed.This post will be updated when new coins are supported, or when new development is occurring.",

Because of the major changes in this release, we highly recommend you backup your OpenBazaar data before you update.Previously, OpenBazaar users were forced to use one cryptocurrency at a time. At startup they choose between Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Zcash. From that moment they could only use the coin they chose for all sales or purchases. If they wanted to use another coin, they had to run an entirely separate node.With the 2.3 release OpenBazaar users are no longer forced to use a single cryptocurrency, but can buy, sell, send and receive multiple coins with the same wallet.At the time of release there are four supported cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Zcash. Ethereum support is nearing completion and will be added soon, and other coins will be added later.This video shows you what the multiwallet looks like and how to use it.    ",

                "title": "How OpenBazaar & Bitcoin Could Kill the American Pickers Economy", 
                "content": "By Sam Patterson, OB1 Co-Founder  Note: This post is a bit of speculation on creative use cases for OpenBazaar recently re-inspired by this community post on Reddit. OpenBazaar is a simple cryptocurrency marketplace built on an open-source network that can be used, grown and changed by users around the world.  Let us know what your creative ideas for OpenBazaar are on Reddit, in Slack, or on Twitter!It’s the holiday season again. Like many people, I have been thinking a lot about the stuff we acquire and exchange as a demonstration of love this time of year.Stuff.Things.Possessions.Those of us in the western world often have a lot of stuff already and this season encourages us to acquire more. It made me think about how many of us even really know how much stuff we already have and my fascination with the TV show American Pickers. If you haven’t watched it before, take 2 minutes to watch this clip:    This clip demonstrates a few common themes in the show:  The owner of the item had lost track of where it was. Often in the show, the owners aren’t even aware of the item’s existence.  The method to determine a price to sell the item was informal and time-consuming. There’s a good chance one of the parties in the trade was far away from a ‘market price’.  Transactions are done in person, in cash.The setting of the show is somewhat unique; they typically find rural collectors who have barns full of old items. But some of the themes of the show are mirrored in the broader economy as well, at least in developed economies.How Do We Know What Stuff We Already Have?Keeping track of personal possessions depends largely on the individual, but it is usually done informally. Few people formally track all the objects they own. One popular method is simple: don’t keep track, and have periodic yard sales to deal with excess possessions. On a somewhat regular basis (typically each spring or summer), people will sort through their possessions and determine which items they want to keep, and which they are willing to sell. In this sense, a yard sale serves the following functions:  Periodically updating your own knowledge about your possessions and how much you value them.  Transmitting some of that information to your local community by displaying those items publicly and pricing them.  Reducing the number of unwanted possessions and increasing cash (or occasionally improve possessions through barter).  (As an aside, this might explain how ‘pickers’ can be successful; their physical presence and interest in your possessions is a simpler method for achieving these three functions.)This method of keeping track of possessions has worked well enough for most people, but it’s far from ideal. The largest cost is time. Preparation requires manually sorting goods and determining their price, physically sorting them (and putting back what wasn’t sold later), then waiting for others to take an interest in them. A yard sale typically takes at least a day’s worth of activity. The haggling itself - similar to the pickers - benefits those who have more information about the product.The advent of the Internet is already allowing better methods. Online platforms for buying and selling goods allow people to more effectively sell their unwanted possessions by opening up the information beyond the local community. However, these platforms have significant drawbacks:  The platforms charge fees, and the payment methods they use often charge fees as well.  The platforms monitor the data of the people listing their possessions, which is typically tied to their real-world identity.  The platforms have their own restrictions around listing possessions, from type of goods they allow to the length of time they can be hosted.Using these platforms is an incremental improvement over the yard sale. It still requires manually assessing and valuing your own possessions.How OpenBazaar and Bitcoin can Manage Personal PossessionsOpenBazaar is a decentralized network for trade; users run the software locally and connect directly to other users to buy and sell goods and services. There is no central institution to take a cut, monitor data, or restrict trade.Bitcoin is a digital currency and payment network; users control their own money locally and aren’t reliant on banks or payment processors.Together, these platforms could change the way we keep track of our personal possessions. Our own knowledge of our possessions - and their value - doesn’t need to be manually re-evaluated informally and periodically, but instead continually tracked and updated. Nor does this information need to be manually transmitted to the local or global community; it can be automatically (and anonymously) displayed to the world, continuously, at no cost.This can be achieved by representing possessions as Ricardian contracts (I’ll just refer to them as contracts), and publishing them to the OpenBazaar network. Ricardian contracts are a data structure that allows goods and services to be represented electronically; these contracts allow users to put in any information about a possession as well as the price they value the good at. When a user creates a contract, the OpenBazaar client publishes the information to the network, and other users can view that contract.If they choose, the user could put in a price for which they’d be willing to sell the item. If anyone in the world values that possession more than the current owner, they could instantly make an offer.If a user isn’t willing to sell a possession, they could simply create a contract and choose to keep the information about it stored locally.The DownsideRetroactively listing possessions as contracts would be time-consuming. However, if a user were to begin creating contracts for all new possessions they gain, eventually most or all of their possessions would be recorded as contracts in their OpenBazaar client.The Present and The FutureFortunately, much of commerce is already moving to the Internet, and the process of recording information about possessions is moving from a manual task to one which could easily be automated.If you acquire an item via OpenBazaar, this could be done easily. Information about the contract purchased would simply change ownership to the new user. Using other major platforms could also be simple with importing tools, likely done via a browser plugin or something similar. Anything purchased via Amazon would automatically be represented as a contract. Apps using UPC scanners could automatically create contracts.  This system would allow all possessions to have a continuous digital representation, and associated value, at no cost to the user.What do you think? What other interesting use cases can you think of for a system like OpenBazaar? What would you like to see it do in the future? Tell us about it on Reddit, in Slack, or on Twitter!",

What’s an OpenBazaar user to do when they find themselves already in December and they still need to buy some gifts and/or squeeze in a few more sales?Thankfully, disaster can still be avoided with a quick pause to regroup.  Buyers: are you running a little behind and still need a great gift for the other cryptocurrency lovers in your life? Make a real statement by using your coins to buy their gifts on OpenBazaar.Get shoppingIf you haven’t already, start browsing now! OpenBazaar.com makes this incredibly easy for you to do anywhere you have an internet-connected device. When you are ready to buy your gifts, just open the same listings with your desktop app to pay.Remember production and shipping timesMost vendors on OpenBazaar are individuals or small businesses who run everything themselves. You may have just fallen in love with an item but if you need it by a specific time, make sure the vendor can deliver it by then. For custom or handmade goods, be sure to check with the vendor about what they have ready to ship and their current production &amp; shipping times. Also note where in the world they are shipping from to estimate how long it will take to arrive.Look for dealsLots of OpenBazaar vendors are still offering promotions right now like this one:use coupon code &quot;xmas&quot; to get %15 off any shirts for your super normal presents for people this holiday season. https://t.co/bZImpRezxpif btc, use @openbazaar discount already included in price ob://QmTwutUrwXS3bh5rfSXriJCNayToD44VpWJbm6DwKuVc2U/store&mdash; YOUR HYDRA (@BraveTheWorld) December 6, 2018There are still some nice deals to be had out there so keep an eye out for them. We will be sharing any great deals we find on our social media, too!  Sellers: Do you still want to earn a few more cryptocoins this month? Here are some tips to do so and not run yourself ragged.Check in with yourself and your businessSure, a bit more Bitcoin is always great but make sure you are realistic about what it will take you to get through any additional orders this month so that you don’t overextend yourself. Account for how long it takes you to make, acquire, package and send your items and about how long it takes to arrive in different locations so that you can advise your buyers well.Know your cutoff timeMake sure you know the last day you can accept orders in order to get them to buyers before the holiday they are celebrating. This is especially important if you do handmade or other custom work. Also, do you want to take some time off this month? Make sure you aren’t chasing orders into your own holiday and set your OpenBazaar store to “off” a few days prior.Promote &amp; offer incentivesA great way to promote yourself and encourage a little sales push is to use social media to talk about special offers you have. Vendors are still offering incentives for buyers like discounts and bonus gifts right now. If your capacity allows for it, give your potential buyers some extra reasons to give their business to you over the hundreds of other vendors competing for their attention.  Tip: You can easily add coupon codes to your items on OpenBazaar following these steps.We all still have some work left to do if we celebrate holidays in December so while this may not eliminate stress, hopefully thinking through these things can help you minimize it.Happy holidays!",

                "title": "OpenBazaar 2 Turns 1: Lessons Learned", 
                "content": "This month we’ve been celebrating the one year anniversary of OpenBazaar 2.0. To read a summary of the last year, read Brian Hoffman’s piece.OpenBazaar started more than four years ago, and for everyone involved it has been an incredible learning experience. Here are a few lessons we’ve learned over the years, with a particular emphasis on the past year.1. Expect politics.Just like Bitcoin, OpenBazaar is an open source piece of software and a network of people running the software. As such, it’s incapable of having a “position” on any given issue. However, the individuals and companies building OpenBazaar do have opinions about issues in the cryptocurrency space. When they promote these beliefs – particularly on controversial issues – others will often claim “OpenBazaar believes X” instead of correctly attributing the opinion to the individual or company.When we started building OpenBazaar in mid-2014 the community of people using cryptocurrencies was smaller, primarily focused on Bitcoin, and the majority of people agreed that building infrastructure in order to use cryptocurrency was worthwhile and necessary for broader adoption.Over the next few years the community got larger and also began to disagree on the future of Bitcoin, such as how (or even if) it should scale. OpenBazaar itself played no role in this “scaling debate,” remaining neutral and following whichever chain the market decided upon. While the project itself was neutral, the individuals and companies working on OpenBazaar weren’t. In the new tribalist atmosphere created during the block size debate, this caused many to ascribe the individual positions of developers to the project itself, leading some to withdrawal their support and no longer use the marketplace.For better or worse, the cryptocurrency space has become politicized over the past few years, and we now recognize the importance of emphasizing the project’s neutrality.2. Plan for all possible future scenarios—including unfavorable ones.This lesson learned is also related to the scaling debate mentioned above. We recognized the possibility that fees could get high enough to prevent people from using Bitcoin for commerce. As individuals and as a company we supported efforts to keep Bitcoin functioning and not get to that point. Unfortunately, it happened anyway.  On the day OpenBazaar 2.0 launched the average Bitcoin fee was ~$5 per transaction and rising.Even though we already knew high fees were a possibility, this all happened in a very short timeframe and forced us to react as quickly as possible. Since Bitcoin wasn’t usable for commerce at that moment, we decided to add support for new, usable cryptocurrencies into the client immediately.This put us in the situation of publishing a Bitcoin-only product in November of 2017 and then needing to put all our development efforts into making it a multi-coin product immediately afterwards, which was several months of work. Had we decided at the beginning to build OpenBazaar 2.0 with support for multiple coins it likely would have been simpler and the resulting UX would have been better.Knowing about future scenarios and trying to make or prevent them from happening isn’t sufficient. You need to have plans in place for facing whatever reality meets your product.3. Don’t get overly focused on a single product.OpenBazaar is a desktop application. This is primarily for technical reasons; building a completely peer-to-peer application is tough for desktop only and even more so in a web browser or on a mobile device.The second reason is due to momentum. We started on desktop and have continued iterating on desktop because, while it has been a difficult undertaking, it was one we became very familiar with.Web and mobile are implementations we are actively working on and have dreamed of realizing since the beginning, but they require very different engineering approaches and even philosophies. For them to begin development we had to deliberately choose to direct significant resources to them and many of the decisions made along these paths have not been easy.Web-connected technology is evolving quickly now and organizations working in a sector like cryptocurrencies need to demonstrate 2 extremes: focus and flexibility. People are solving hard problems every day using this very new technology while also facing a growing market with changing desires. They need to be both steadfast and nimble to tackle each day that may change all of their grandest plans.We’ve learned a lot about developing open source software, managing a community and dealing with the changes and growth of cryptocurrencies over the past few years, and we certainly haven’t been perfect. We appreciate the knowledge we have gained, and are executing against it in our daily work. We look forward to learning much more as we continue building the largest and most free decentralized ecommerce platform on the internet with you.",

                "content": "What’s Happening with Bitcoin Cash?There is a Bitcoin Cash network upgrade beginning at 4:40PM UTC on November 15th, 2018. Depending on how the upgrade is accepted by the network, the Bitcoin Cash blockchain could fork into two or more incompatible chains.It’s important to note that transacting is dangerous during a hard fork like this unless it’s between addresses you entirely control. If you transact BCH to an address you don’t control you could lose access to your coins on other forks.In order to help OpenBazaar users prepare for the hard fork, here is some information about the OpenBazaar wallet that can help you decide how to handle any BCH you may have stored there.How Will The Bitcoin Cash Upgrade Affect My OpenBazaar Funds?Users of OpenBazaar 2.2.5 and prior who have an active BCH wallet are using a local SPV-based wallet. SPV wallets are designed to follow the chain that has the most cumulative proof-of-work according to the existing Bitcoin Cash difficulty rules. The SPV wallet in OpenBazaar will follow the longest chain served by the peers it’s able to connect to. We advise that you withdraw your BCH from your OpenBazaar wallet until the chains settle.Withdraw Your BCH to Electron  Users of an OpenBazaar wallet control their funds by having sole access to their keys. The wallet maintains its keys and seed locally on your computer which you can backup to a safe location using these steps. Then, import your seed into a BIP39-compatible wallet (such as Electron Cash ) to keep your funds safe through the fork.The OB1 team will continue to observe the network upgrade and will take further actions as necessary to ensure the safety of our users’ funds at rest within the OpenBazaar wallet.What Should I Do Next?For the next few weeks, make sure you have the keys to your OpenBazaar wallet stored somewhere safe as complications may arise. When things settle it is entirely your choice what you do with your coins, but we also recommend being cautious of a chain with hash power of 50% or more controlled by one entity.In ConclusionOpenBazaar is a private, open-source marketplace powered by cryptocurrency that is making trade free for everyone, everywhere. The development team at OB1 is committed to building a secure and reliable transactional environment for users around the world. We do our best to ensure that you have the knowledge you need to make the best decisions for you and your coins.

                "title": "Big Change, Hard Work and Strong Growth—OpenBazaar 2 Turns 1", 
                "content": "by Brian Hoffman, CEO, OB1The years leading up to OpenBazaar 2.0 went by in a flash, it seems, culminating in our best and most capable software release ever this month last year. Since then it’s been a whirlwind of development milestones, bug fixes, crypto political drama, and flying all over the world to promote the benefits of private, free trade for everyone.  Over 100,000 users have experienced the power of OpenBazaar 2.0 since it launched and it keeps growing bigger and stronger. All of our hard work continues to drive us collectively toward a better future for crypto users.The Road to HereWe knew we were onto something great with version 1.0 of OpenBazaar. We used exciting, emerging technologies to build it but we discovered limits we wanted to push past to get the experience right for our users.Development of OpenBazaar 2.0 started many months before its release late last year and took many hours of planning and designing from a large group of team members covering visual design, technical architecture, UX and UI development, community evangelism and marketing strategy.  Some critical decisions were made to improve the experience of OpenBazaar, like scrapping our fully decentralized search feature in favor of using third party search engines (much like how Bittorrent operates), and replacing our shoddy p2p protocol with Protocol Labs’ IPFS and libp2p. This made our network connectivity improve greatly (though we still have a lot of work to do) and laid the groundwork for getting us to mobile and web applications.Bitcoin BreakdownThese changes took a long time to implement and deliver, but the team did so fairly seamlessly on November 1st, 2017. There wasn’t much time to celebrate though as a transaction fee crisis was happening in parallel with a massive uptick in interest in Bitcoin. This sent the team into disarray as we struggled to find users who wanted to pay $30 in fees just to buy something like a $20 t-shirt in the marketplace.After some consternation we decided the only solution was to expand our payment options to include other currencies to ease the scalability pains felt by our users and so in January we released Bitcoin Cash and ZCash (Beta) support for OpenBazaar. We are proud that we’ve been able to bring OpenBazaar to a broader community of crypto enthusiasts and are continuing that work today.Wonder What’s Next?In 2018 the breadth of crypto projects has increased exponentially through ERC-20 token issuances, completely new blockchains, layer two networks and more. We understand that there is a growing number of people interested in using all kinds of cryptocurrencies — not just Bitcoin — for e-commerce, coin trading, rewarding others for content creation and other use cases. OpenBazaar was always designed as a project for the world, not just for Bitcoin, and we’re hard at work re-engineering it to support new coins and communities.Our next release will center on the multiwallet which will allow users to send and receive payments from one wallet instance that can hold these five coins: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Zcash, Ethereum and Litecoin. We hope to introduce this new capability soon, followed by even more coins.  Want to see more? Click here for an interactive demo!OB1 is also bringing OpenBazaar to mobile with our own iOS and Android apps. We’re pioneering the technology to make a truly decentralized web version of OpenBazaar so that anyone can run it in their own standard browser. It’s an extremely bright future and every day thousands of new people are learning about the power of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other crypto projects.There are even more exciting developments on the horizon beyond these ambitious releases that I can’t wait to share with you. Please sign up for our newsletter to learn about them as they are announced.OpenBazaar 2 Turns 1This month we are celebrating one year since the release of OpenBazaar 2.0 with promotions and events all month long. Connect with us on Reddit, Facebook and Slack to learn more and follow along on Twitter with the hashtag #OB2Turns1.In ConclusionEvery day we use technologies that make our lives easier, but at the expense of our privacy or security. We’re working on this freedom-focused project to give individuals another choice for how they buy, sell and share their information online, one that respects these values we share.  This movement is about taking control of the future we want to see for ourselves and our neighbors all around the world.We are excited to keep working with you on this project and to help it grow together. We can only do it with your support so please spread the word and help us make OpenBazaar even better.",

                "title": "Why We Are Integrating Ethereum into OpenBazaar", 
                "content": "In a previous article we explained how we’re integrating Ethereum into OpenBazaar in addition to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Zcash. In this article we want to talk about why we’re integrating Ethereum.Bitcoin BeginningsOpenBazaar began as a Bitcoin-only project, with the intent of creating an open, permissionless marketplace with no fees and no middlemen. From the beginning users wanted the ability to accept payments in cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin. While that was possible via our Shapeshift integration, such payments weren’t really trustless. Non-bitcoin payments would just be Shapeshifted into bitcoin payments. Users effectively had to use Shapeshift as a middleman, had to trust them not to steal their funds, and had to pay them for the privilege. In that sense, non-bitcoin payments weren’t really native to OpenBazaar.Then, in late 2017, bitcoin transaction fees began to rise. A lot. Using bitcoin for payments on OpenBazaar became impractical for months. Since payments in non-bitcoin currencies weren’t native on OpenBazaar (they were simply Shapefshifted into bitcoin payments) that meant all payments on OpenBazaar were impractical. Users wanted to use alternative currencies, but we were – effectively – forcing them to use bitcoin. Use of the platform ground to a halt. It was obvious something needed to change.Becoming Crypto-InclusiveWe want users to be able to trade using any cryptocurrency they desire, without exposure to risks caused by other chains. In early 2018, in response to urgent demand from our users, we began integrating native altcoin payments into OpenBazaar. We’re refactoring our codebase to make it much easier to integrate new cryptocurrencies natively. The low hanging fruits are coins that are forks of Bitcoin, as their codebases are closest to what OpenBazaar was already supporting. Bitcoin Cash and Zcash were the first such integrations, and Litecoin integration is almost complete.Enter EthereumA natural continuation of that effort is to integrate Ethereum. Since Ethereum doesn’t share Bitcoin’s codebase, it has been more challenging to integrate than forks of Bitcoin. But we think it’s worth the effort because:  Ethereum has the largest community outside of Bitcoin.  Developer activity on Ethereum is huge and enthusiastic.  The community has a special eagerness for its coin and tokens to be used for real-world commerce.Integrating ETH and ERC20 payments is a natural next-step for OpenBazaar.Beyond simple payments, smart contracts built on Ethereum – with its rich Turing-complete scripting language – may allow us to support markets that would be extremely challenging to support with Bitcoin-like script-based cryptocurrencies. Trustless auctions, DAO-based stores, insurance contracts, and affiliate marketing are just a few of the ideas we are exploring. Integrating Ethereum has the potential to expand the types of products and services offered on the platform.Users won’t be required to use Ethereum to use OpenBazaar, and can still stick to paying and being paid in Bitcoin or other supported cryptocurrencies.In SummaryIn short, the landscape isn’t what it was when OpenBazaar first started. There is a rich ecosystem we cannot afford to ignore, and Ethereum is a huge part of that. We’re excited about implementing ETH and ERC20 payments, and are looking forward to working with the Ethereum community as we explore how we can leverage smart contracts in OpenBazaar.",

                "title": "Escrow Smart Contract Specification in OpenBazaar", 
                "content": "By Austin Williams, OpenBazaar ResearcherThe integration of Ethereum into OpenBazaar represents one of the most challenging and rewarding tasks we’ve done for the project so far. We are so excited to bring our vision of seeing cryptocurrency and tokens used for real-world commerce to the Ethereum community!Welcome to the family! Look forward to seeing what you and openbazaar come up with&mdash; Vitalik Non-giver of Ether (@VitalikButerin) April 19, 2018IntroductionOpenBazaar facilitates trades between arbitrary third parties on the internet. Currently, only UTXO-based cryptocurrencies can be used as a medium of exchange on OpenBazaar. The escrow contract is intended to be used as a way to shoehorn Ethereum functionality into OpenBazaar’s existing framework so that users can trade using ETH and ERC20 tokens as their medium of exchange.How OpenBazaar Trades Currently Work (in UTXO land)Moderated PaymentsWhen a buyer and seller have agreed on a product and a price, the buyer sends their funds to an escrow address, which is a 2-of-3 multisig address with one key controlled by the buyer, one key controlled by the seller, and one key controlled by a moderator that has been agreed upon by both the buyer and the seller.On the “happy path”, the seller delivers the goods, then the buyer releases the funds to the seller (with the buyer and seller signing the payout transaction from the escrow address).In the event that the seller does not deliver the goods as promised, the buyer pleads their case to the moderator, and the buyer &amp; moderator can send the funds from escrow back to the buyer.In the (very common) case where the buyer receives their goods but doesn’t release the funds to the seller, the seller presents their case to the moderator, and the seller &amp; moderator sign the funds from escrow to the seller.The seller can also unilaterally release funds from escrow after a previously agreed upon amount of time has passed. This allows the seller to release the funds from escrow without the moderator in the event that the buyer disappears. With UTXO-based coins, this is achieved by requiring that the buyer sign an nLockTime transaction releasing funds to the seller, and then passing that transaction to the seller (off-chain) before the seller delivers the product or service.Direct PaymentsBuyers have the option of not using a moderator when making an OpenBazaar trade. While this isn’t recommended, it may be an acceptable risk for the buyer if the buyer trusts the seller. Direct or unmoderated payments come in two forms: online payments and offline payments.Online direct payments occur when the buyer knows the seller is online. For online payments, the buyer simply sends the funds directly to the seller’s wallet after requesting an address to pay to. These are simple, classic transfers of value from one account to another.Offline payments occur when the buyer sees that the seller is offline and is uncertain whether the seller will ever come back online. In this case the buyer sends the funds to a 1-of-2 multisig address with one key held by the buyer and the other held by the seller. If the seller comes back online, they can accept the funds. If the seller doesn’t come back online, the buyer can reclaim the funds.Limitations Imposed by OpenBazaar’s Wallet InterfaceOpenBazaar interacts with all supported coins through its wallet interface. This means that OpenBazaar’s Ethereum smart contracts must be designed in such a way as to be compatible with that interface. OpenBazaar is a live/launched product, so making big changes to the wallet interface in order to support Ethereum is non-trivial. Instead, we’ve decided to keep the wallet interface fixed (for now), and design the smart contract to be compatible with it.Intended Use of the Escrow contractThe Escrow contract will store the escrowed funds and state information for every OpenBazaar trade that is using Ethereum (or ERC20 tokens) as the medium of exchange.We could have, instead, opted to deploy a new escrow contract for each Ethereum-based trade — thereby siloing escrowed funds from each trade in their own smart contract. However, we think the gas requirements for doing so are cost prohibitive, and we fear that would introduce too much friction into Ethereum-based trades.OpenBazaar trades that use ETH/ERC20 as the medium of exchange are intended to follow the same protocol as those that use a UTXO-based coin as the medium of exchange — and the escrow smart contract is intended to facilitate that.Funding the TradeBuyers initiate a trade by creating/storing a Transaction struct in the Escrow contract and (simultaneously) funding the transaction by sending ETH (or ERC20 tokens) to the Escrow contract. At this point the transaction is in the FUNDED state. While in the FUNDED state, the buyer may add more ETH (or ERC20 tokens) to escrow if necessary.Releasing Funds from EscrowWhile the transaction is in the FUNDED state, the escrowed funds can be released only if:  Two of the three participants (buyer, seller, and moderator) agree on how the escrowed funds are to be distributed.  An amount of time (timeoutHourse) has passed since the last time the buyer added funds to escrow.The reasoning behind (2) is that it is very common for buyers to not release funds after they’ve received their goods (this is due more to buyer laziness than malice). In that event, we want to make it easy for the seller to claim the escrowed funds without having to coordinate with a moderator.Funds released from escrow can be split up and sent to various addresses. However, the receiving addresses must be the addresses of the trade’s buyer, seller, or moderator. To reiterate, funds cannot be sent to an address that is not affiliated with the trade in question, but the escrowed funds can be divided up among the participants in any way — so long as 2-of-3 of the parties agree.Upon release of funds from escrow, the trade is put into the RELEASED state. Once in the RELEASED state, trades can no longer be altered. All participants who received some of the escrowed funds are noted in the trade’s Transaction struct (via the beneficiaries mapping).(The beneficiaries information will be used later, by other contracts, to determine whether or not a given trade was disputed, refunded, etc.).Offline Direct PaymentsThe escrow contract can mirror the behavior of UTXO-based offline payments by calling addTransaction (or addTokenTransaction if it is an ERC20 transaction), setting the threshold value to 1, and setting the moderator address to a known, non-zero burn address. The effect is the equivalent of a 1-of-2 multisig address where the buyer holds one key and the seller holds the other.Known Issues / MiscModerator selectionIt is assumed that the moderator is trusted by both the buyer and the seller before the trade begins. The obvious threat of collusion between a buyer and moderator — or seller and moderator — is beyond the scope of this contract.Push vs pullThe transferFunds function uses push payments (rather than the pull model) due to limitations imposed by OpenBazaar’s wallet interface. Hence any of the beneficiaries of a payout from escrow can cause the payout to fail (for example, by putting a revert() in their fallback function).Game theoretically speaking, such a DoS attack is irrational for any of the participants capable of causing such an issue, because the honest parties can always benefit by removing the offending party as a beneficiary and taking her share of the payout.For example, suppose the three parties agreed that the moderator would received 5% of the funds, and that the buyer and seller would split the remaining funds. The seller, being unhappy with the result, could cause the payout to fail until she could negotiate a more favorable agreement. However, the buyer &amp; moderator — upon seeing the seller’s misbehavior — could simply agree to remove the seller as a beneficiary — thus removing the seller’s ability to DoS the payout.)For this reason, we consider the DoS possibility caused by use of push payments in the transferFunds function to be low risk.SecurityQuality assuranceThe code for the escrow smart contract can be found in Github here. We invite the community to examine the code and post issues or suggestions. Furthermore, we have written 37 tests for the contract to achieve &gt;90% code coverage.AuditWe’ll be working with OpenZeppelin to have the contracts audited and hope to have the audit process completed before the end of the year.Special thanksWe’d like to extend a special thanks to the following folks who helped us get here:  Andrey 🦃 Petrov  Ashwin Mangale  Sameep Singhania  Austin Williams  Chris Pacia  OpenZeppelin",

                "title": "How to Buy Cryptocurrencies Privately with no Fees", 
                "content": "This tutorial will explain how to purchase cryptocurrencies on OpenBazaar, a decentralized marketplace which never has platform fees and doesn’t require registering an account. You’ll learn how to buy cryptocurrency with a different cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin. At the moment OpenBazaar doesn’t support people buying cryptocurrency with regular fiat money such as US Dollars or Euros, though it’s a feature that will hopefully be supported in the future.Here’s a video tutorial explaining the process:    Step #1: Download OpenBazaarVisit OpenBazaar.org and click on the installer link for your operating system. Once the installer file is downloaded, open the file and it will begin the process of installing OpenBazaar.Step #2: Select cryptocurrencyYou will be asked which cryptocurrency you want to use. This is the cryptocurrency that you will pay with as a buyer, or receive as a seller. This is not the currency that you wish to purchase.At the moment OpenBazaar users are limited to using only one cryptocurrency at a time, and can only choose BTC, BCH, or ZEC. However in the near future users will be able to use multiple currencies at the same time, and will have LTC, ETH, and other coins available to use.Step #3: Complete OnboardingGo through the onboarding process and enter whatever information you choose. If you want to remain private then keep the randomly generated name assigned to you. Choose the currency you want to have prices displayed in; you’ll want this to be the currency that you most commonly use so that the prices of goods and services are familiar to you.Read the terms of service, and if you agree then accept them.Step #4: Search for cryptocurrency listingsYou’re now up and running on OpenBazaar, so let’s find some cryptocurrency listings. Click the “Discover” button on the top right of the client (the blue tent). After selecting a search provider, you’ll now see lots of listings on the network. To filter down to only cryptocurrency offerings, use the search provider’s filters on the left. You’ll now see a list of cryptocurrencies for sale. Find what you want and click on the listing to view it.Step #5: Buy the cryptocurrencyIt’s recommended that you find a vendor who has a “Verified Moderator” on their listings. This means you will be able to choose escrow from a reputable third party. You can tell if they offer a verified moderator by looking for a little orange badge underneath the seller’s name.Now that you’ve found some crypto you want to buy, click the “Trade now” button to start the checkout process. You’ll need to enter a receiving address for the funds you’re buying. As in the example below, if you’re buying Decred then you’ll need to put in a Decred address that you control where the seller will send the cryptocurrency you buy.Then choose payment type. Unless you fully trust the vendor, you should use a moderated payment with a verified moderator. Enter the amount you wish to buy, then review your order and click “Pay.” You’ll now see the payment screen.Step #6: Send PaymentOnce you’ve placed the order you now need to pay for it. There are two ways to pay in OpenBazaar. One is by scanning the QR code on a mobile wallet or copying the details on the payment screen into a separate wallet and sending payment. The other method is using the internal OpenBazaar wallet.If you don’t want to use a separate wallet, or you try using an external wallet and you receive an error message, then it’s best to use the internal OpenBazaar wallet and click the “Pay from Wallet” button.Before you can pay from the OpenBazaar wallet, you’ll need to fund it. To do this, click on the wallet button, then in the wallet interface click “Receive Money.” This will display a QR code and address you can use to fund the wallet. Note that you’ll need to wait for one confirmation on the blockchain before the funds are spendable.To pay for orders you’ve already placed, click on “Purchases” in the dropdown menu on the top right (your profile picture) and then click on the specific order.Once payment has been sent you’ll see a green check mark appear and it’s now up to the vendor to fulfill your order.Step #7: Check your orderTo check your order, click on “Purchases” in the dropdown menu on the top right (your profile picture) and then click on the specific order. You’ll see a bar showing the progress of the order.Once the seller fulfills the order you should see it showing “fulfilled,” and the vendor should send confirmation such as a transaction hash to prove they sent the funds to the address you provided. Enter the transaction hash into a block explorer to verify, or just check the wallet where you expected the funds to be sent. If you’ve received them, leave a review and close the order out. It’s important that you do finish the order, otherwise the funds will not be released from escrow and the seller will be forced to open a dispute to claim their funds.If you don’t receive the funds in a reasonable period, message the seller to ask why. If you get no response after a while or something else is wrong with your order, you can choose to open a dispute with the moderator by clicking the “Dispute Order” button when viewing the order in your purchases.OpenBazaar is also a platform for goods and services. While you’re waiting for the vendor to send your new coins, check out what the marketplace has to offer.Now you know how to purchase cryptocurrencies privately and with no fees using OpenBazaar.Get involved with our community on Slack and Reddit and make even a small purchase on OpenBazaar today to see what you think!

                "content": "Can cryptocurrency really be used as a “currency?” Is it something we should spend on everyday goods and services? What about when the price shoots up and we know how valuable it can be if we hodl it?Here’s a broad definition of a currency:  “Something (such as coins, treasury notes, and banknotes) that is in circulation as a medium of exchange.”A currency can be anything that multiple people agree has value and they’re willing to exchange for other things, such as goods or services.For example, how do you know that a t-shirt is worth $20? It’s because that’s a generally accepted market price, which leads to you and a specific vendor trading a shirt for $20.Do cryptocurrencies have value we can measure?Yes, cryptocurrencies that are traded on exchanges have value measured next to national currencies so you can track their value at any given time. They also have value on their own, but due to their newness most people make sense of cryptocurrency values in terms of other existing currencies. For now it’s still easier to understand what exchanging $20 for a t-shirt means rather than “0.0031 BTC.”Here are 4 reasons why you should buy things with your cryptocurrency!1. It’s easy with OpenBazaarIt’s now easier than ever to discover things you’d like to buy with the brand new browsing website at openbazaar.com. When you’re ready to buy, just download &amp; set up your own node in less than a minute.2. There are thousands of great items &amp; services availableOn OpenBazaar you can use your cryptocurrency to shop at great stores like these:Casa Store on OpenBazaarMatthew Zipkin Store on OpenBazaarThe Queendoms of Plameo on OpenBazaarVisit stores from around the world where people just like you, who believe in the power of cryptocurrency, are working on their entrepreneurial hustle. Some people are selling on OpenBazaar because they don’t have access to other online marketplaces due to the cost of participating or restrictions based on their location. Some users are also on OpenBazaar because their products are very fringe or niche such as religious objects or political items. It’s exciting to see how a decentralized marketplace can connect all types of people!3. Protect your privacy by using cryptocurrencyEach time you buy something on a large e-commerce platform with a credit card you are forced to share your personal data with multiple companies, who then add this data into a profile they’ve built about you.While cryptocurrencies don’t offer complete privacy, they are more private than credit cards. By purchasing on a platform like OpenBazaar you never share personal data with a centralized platform, only with the vendor you are purchasing a physical item from. If you purchase digital goods or services you aren’t forced to give any personal information at all.4. Help build the future you want to seeWe have seen ups and downs with the cryptocurrency market but we’re not in this because of the speculation frenzy. We’re in this because it is the ground floor of a huge technological revolution.Crypto-commerce still has a way to go but we don’t get to the future we believe in by waiting—we get there by doing. The OpenBazaar development team believes this and built this decentralized marketplace specifically to utilize the special qualities of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.  The bottom line is we like cryptocurrency and we want to see it put to work.Wouldn’t you like to use money that lets you be in control of it? Money with values set by markets around the world, not exclusively by too-big-to-fail banks and questionable governments?People who are buying and selling on OpenBazaar believe in using cryptocurrencies AS currencies to exchange for goods and services they need or want. If you believe this too, then OpenBazaar is a great place for you.Get involved with our community on Slack and Reddit and make even a small purchase on OpenBazaar today to see what you think!

                "content": "OpenBazaar is not like a regular online marketplace.It’s a decentralized online marketplace.OpenBazaar is like its own separate part of the internet. It’s a network of users who connect directly to one another instead of to centralized websites like Amazon or Ebay.The decentralized architecture that makes it powerful can also make it a bit hard to understand at first.      Why does it have to be downloaded?        Why does it only use cryptocurrency for payments?        How do the different payment types work?  OB1, the team leading the development of OpenBazaar, has designed a few things that make it easier to use.  These items are add-ons and are less decentralized than the network itself. They make shopping easier but they do not change the decentralized protocol nor the privacy or security of your transactions.1. Easy DiscoveryThere are search engines within the application that help you discover items. OB1 created the first search engine but anyone is welcome to build one and make it available for others to add to their own OpenBazaar instance.With OB1 search you can choose from a selection of suggested categories or search by shipping location, coin payment type, moderator type, or rating. You can also toggle adult filters on and off or search within different product types including physical goods, cryptocurrencies, digital goods, and services.2. OB1 Verified Moderators    Moderators are a type of user on the OpenBazaar network who can be added to a transaction to help in case of a dispute. It’s important to choose a quality moderator for this type of payment. OB1 offers a Verified Moderator service to help users determine which moderators are more likely to be trustworthy.3. Browse The WebsiteThere is now a website where buyers can see what’s available and start shopping right in their browser! Check it out at OpenBazaar.com or from within the application click “View on web” in the top right of the address bar to view a store or item page in your browser.ConclusionEmerging technology that focuses on decentralizing the Internet is exciting, but still new. There are many challenges to overcome when building decentralized applications but we are optimistic about industry progress. Working through these challenges is a point of pride for the development team and we are excited to keep building a better and better user experience for OpenBazaar.",

                "title": "5 Tips To Make Your OpenBazaar Listings Pop", 
                "content": "By Monique Boediono, OpenBazaar UX DesignerE-commerce is an exciting and flexible way to start your own business. With some e-commerce business models you can even earn money from the comfort of your own home. While there are many opportunities to get started, there are also many ways to get lost in the crowd.With OpenBazaar, the world’s largest decentralized marketplace, you can build your store and listings faster than on any other network. We have some tips that will help your store stand out.If you have something you’ve been itching to sell on OpenBazaar, here are 5 tips to help make your listings POP on the network! 🎈1. Write a descriptive titleYour title should give your buyers a clear idea of what you’re selling. When writing a title, try throwing in a few descriptive keywords to give your listing some extra oomph. For example, “hand-crafted pure copper jug with lid” is a lot more interesting and helpful than just “water jug”.2. Take many, many photos 📸If a picture is worth a thousand words and you can attach up to 30 photos for every listing, that should save you 30,000 words (and way too many headaches), right? Take advantage of this.Photos are arguably the most important part of a listing – it’s the closest a buyer can come to seeing your product in person. Take clear, high-quality pictures in plenty of light to really let your product shine.Get rid of background clutterDon’t detract from the star of the show. Stage your product against a plain background. This removes distractions and allows your product to stand out.  TIP: Can’t find a good plain surface anywhere? Textured surfaces can also work well. Place your product on marble counters and wooden coffee tables. Or, just hang up a bedsheet!Give us varietyShow us how your product looks with different angles and settings. Snap some closeups to capture unique and intricate details. Showcase your product in action. If you’re selling a t-shirt, take photos of the shirt on a model so your buyers can see how much cooler it looks on a human being.Don’t forget to include photos of variants too! If you’re selling the same dress in red, white, and black, show us what each of them looks like.Choose your primary photoYour primary photo is the first thing a buyer will see when they find your listing. It’s both the thumbnail image and the cover photo on your listing’s main page. You want to make a stellar first impression, so use your most captivating photo as your listing’s primary photo. To do this, click your chosen photo and drag it left to the the first spot in the list of pictures.Ideally, your primary photo should capture your product as a whole. So instead of a close-up detail shot, try to choose a photo that shows your product in full view.3. Give us the deets ☕Details are key, so don’t skimp on product descriptions! Start with the basics first: what’s for sale?  Handmade red mini tassel earrings  Vintage whiskey decanter set with matching glasses  New Age Beets headphones: powered purely by organic beet juiceThen, go into more detail.ColourColours are deceivingly hard to convey through photos. How a shade looks can vary wildly depending on lighting, or the kind of device you’re using to view it. Give your buyers a more accurate understanding of an item’s colour by using more specific descriptors.For example, instead of “red”, try:  Vermillion  Crimson  Raspberry  Burgundy  TIP: If you’re stuck on words, check out Ingrid Sundberg’s Colour ThesaurusImage from Ingrid Sundberg’s Colour ThesaurusSizeBust out the tape measure so you can let people know how big or small your item is. If you’re selling clothing, it’s helpful to include a size guide like this:MaterialWhat’s your product made of? Stainless steel, copper, wood, bamboo… If this lip balm features beeswax collected from your own personal backyard apiary, be sure to let your buyers know!How to useGive us some instructions on how to use and care for your product. For example: Where should it be stored? Is it dishwasher safe or hand wash only? Can I toss it in the dryer?Inspire your buyers. Show them different ways to use your product. If you’re selling a scarf, offer a few examples for how they can wear and style that scarf.On top of that, you can also give them some ideas for how a product might fit into their lives –  This Kindle would be a great gift for your neighborhood bookworm who may or may not have a hoarding problem!  Does your cat take massive poops? Our double-duty clothespin doubles as a nostril clamp!Absolutely irresistible.4. Break up long blocks of textProduct descriptions or store policies can get lengthy. Don’t make your buyer slog through line after line of text. Instead, format your content to help them find the information they need.Write short paragraphsKeep your paragraphs to 3-5 lines max. If you have a lot to communicate, try organizing the content into sections with header titles. It will make the information much less intimidating and easier to digest. For example, in your product description, you can have sections for key features, dimensions, or care instructions.Use bullet pointsBullet points are your friends! They’re easy to read and convey a lot of information very quickly. Use them when you can. They’re especially helpful when listing product features.Format your textA little text formatting can go a long way. Call out important tidbits in bold or italics so they don’t get lost.Add visualsGet creative! Break up your text with photos and GIFs. Visuals can add an instant POP to your content, making it dynamic and engaging. For example, check out this listing by Crypto Republic - BCH.Note: OpenBazaar doesn’t store images that you can include in the description. You need to store them somewhere else on the internet and use their URL to add them.5. Add tags to get your listing discovered!Finally, make sure you tag your products so people can find them on the network. You’ve put a lot of blood and sweat into creating this listing, so you deserve to get some eyeballs on it.When tagging your listing, try to think like a shopper – if you were looking for a product like this, what kind of search terms would you use? Some questions you can ask yourself include:How would a shopper describe this item?For example, if I were looking for a pair of green earrings, I might search:  Jewelery  Earrings  Studs  Green  EmeraldWhy would a shopper be looking for this item?As a shopper, I might not know exactly what I’m looking for. I could be shopping for a gift for my mom. In that case, I might search:  Gifts for her  Mother’s dayFor more information about tagging, check out our blog post here.ConclusionDon’t get lost in the ecommerce crowd. Make sure your OpenBazaar listings are optimized with great titles, photos, details, formatting and tags so that shoppers are so delighted to discover them they can’t help but buy.Once your listings are all set up, make sure to find your store link on the web at openbazaar.com so you can share them with your audience on social media! It may take a bit for them to show up there so please be patient.I hope you enjoyed this post and found it useful.

                "title": "How Decentralized Application Development Nearly Destroyed My World", 
                "content": "By Rob Misiorowski, OpenBazaar Front End DeveloperOk, that title is a little hyperbolic, but decentralized applications with modern user experiences are few and far between and present some unique challenges for front-end developers. In this post I’ll describe some of these challenges and give examples of how we addressed them when developing the OpenBazaar desktop client.Fundamentally Different Paradigms  In a centralized application, the data is primarily stored in and retrieved from one central source.For example, an app has 10,000 thing-a-magoos and they are all stored on a central server that’s administered by professional engineers and has professional quality hardware and software behind it. It’s optimized to process large numbers of client requests for data in a highly streamlined way.This is useful when you need to retrieve and organize many pieces of data, like on a webpage that displays the top 50 thing-a-magoos on the network. With a centralized server, a client can efficiently retrieve the data it needs for all 50 thing-a-magoos in one single call.  Now, let’s consider a similar app, but one that is decentralized.The data doesn’t live in one central location. Each user stores their own data and distributes it to other peers on the network as those peers view the data. Instead of highly optimized hardware, this is a blend of computers ranging from Joe’s 8 year old desktop PC to Jennie’s brand new macbook pro. While some of these may be high end, it’s doubtful that most of these users will have production server level hardware or software. Now, instead of retrieving data from one central location, you likely have to go through all types of home routers and firewalls to get it.Going back to our landing page example from above, instead of making a single call to retrieve data for 50 thing-a-magoos, now we need to make 50 calls (one to each user) to retrieve the data. Actually, it will almost certainly be many multiple multiples of 50, since P2P libraries like IPFS will retrieve the same pieces of data from multiple nodes to compare for authenticity.What Challenges Does This Cause?It’s hopefully getting clearer why there is much more leg-work involved in retrieving data in a decentralized way, but what challenges does this pose for clients?  LatencyThe speed difference is significant between retrieving a single piece of data from a highly optimized production server verses from the home computer of the average person. For example, in the centralized world, if the average server request takes more than a fraction of a second to return—let’s say 250ms—it would often be considered slow and teams of engineers would be having meetings on how to reduce this. In our desktop client, we routinely have requests taking upwards of a minute before possibly timing out. And that’s just for a single request. I’m sure you can imagine the difference between retrieving a list of 50 thing-a-magoos in one request from a central server versus having to make a call for each one across a network of distributed nodes.  Frequent data retrieval errorsConsider a popular centralized app like Facebook. How often do you enter a legitimate url and have some type of error return? I would venture to say hardly ever. In a decentralized app this world is destroyed because quite regularly calls for data fail. Perhaps the user isn’t online, nor are any seeders of the data? Perhaps some are online, but are unreachable? Perhaps you’re even making a call for a piece of data that no longer exists (e.g. a deleted listing)? Further complicating the issue is that we often don’t know the root cause of the failure. The error message could basically just be a large “shrug” emoji.  Browsers live in a centralized worldThe OpenBazaar front end is developed with Electron, which uses Chromium, the tech behind the Google Chrome browser. As such, it’s subject to many of the browser’s restrictions. One of those is that you are limited to 6 concurrent requests to the same domain. Even though we’re ultimately getting the data from many nodes, the requests are proxied through each node’s server. In other words, from the browser’s point of view, a fetch of 20 different user profiles are all coming from the same domain.If latency weren’t an issue this wouldn’t be so bad. Even if a request took a less than ideal 250ms, you would be able to fully display a grid of 24 users in one second. But when requests routinely take 30 seconds, 45 seconds or 1 minute plus, suddenly it takes a whole lot of time to fully display a page. Even more problematic is that your request queue can clog up. Let’s say one profile comes back in a lightning fast 100ms and we display a user box for that user with a Follow button. If there are still 23 pending requests, even if the user clicks that Follow button, it will be put at the end of the queue and not even be called until all but 5 requests remain, which may easily be a few minutes.An Example of How We Addressed These ChallengesOpenBazaar has an integrated chat section that’s really an app within an app. The chat app is present from the time your server starts and remains perpetually in the sidebar. Initially, this was a world destroyer because the little chat heads (the user icons you click to open a conversation with a user) require some profile data from the party you’re conversing with (e.g. avatar, name). If a user is even slightly chatty and has engaged in at least 6 conversations, then those 6 profile calls would be enough to clog up the request queue and potentially prevent critical app functionality from being available.Here’s how we handled some of the challenges decentralization presented us in OpenBazaar chat:  LatencyThe server stores a list of your conversations. Within that data set is the peer ID of each person you are chatting with and the last message in the conversation. This allows us to create a chat head with a default avatar and use the peer ID as the name. The peer ID is also enough to make a link to the user’s page. While it may take up to a minute for the user’s avatar and name show up, at least you’ll have something showing in the client and you won’t be prevented from starting the conversation.Additionally, we implement multiple layers of caching. We can’t do this for all requests because for some it’s important you have fresh data. In this case, however, the user’s name and avatar will likely not change that often and if you do see data that is a few minutes (or occasionally a few days) old, it doesn’t degrade your experience.One level of caching is done on the server where it will store the user’s profile on disk. Then, when you make a call and indicate a cached response is acceptable, the server will immediately send back the cached version and behind-the-scenes make an IPFS query to update the cache. In theory, the cached version will never be more than one revision behind.The other layer of cache is an in-memory client cache. The next time you request a profile where a cached version is ok, it won’t even go to the server, it would use what the client has in-memory. Since this is in-memory, it will only be available until you shut down the app.  Frequent data retrieval errorsOur approach here is exactly the same as our approach to latency: The user will initially see a default avatar and a peer ID but still have everything they need to start a conversation. The fact that the profile fetch may not succeed is really just a visual shortcoming. This is a form of progressive enhancement where we are starting with the bare minimum functionality and attempting to augment the experience along the way.  Browsers live in a centralized worldThis challenge was almost literally a world destroyer. If my memory serves me well, in OpenBazaar version 1.0 we had the chat app initialize before other important start-up functionality. For instance, while the chat app would be waiting on it’s multiple profiles to come back, the Notifications mini-app would be showing you a spinner. Even worse, if you wanted to actually navigate to a page in the app, the data needed to show the page would be queued until all those profile calls finished…which, lest we forget, could be minutes.It was a user experience deal breaker for those requests to be clogging up the queue and preventing critical functionality. But our hands were tied. If the browser imposes such a restriction, what could we do? Eventually, we stumbled upon the fact that the restriction is limited to HTTP requests. Incoming socket messages (which use TCP) have no such restriction. We added an async flag to most of our APIs so that the HTTP request would immediately return with a unique requestId. Subsequently, the profiles would come individually via socket messages. They would each include the requestId so we could map the profile to the initial request.Boom! We could kick off as many profile calls as we wanted and have virtually no impact on the HTTP request queue.In SummaryWhile “world destroying” is a bit dramatic, these challenges were indeed quite challenging! Decentralized applications with an intended user base of non-engineers (i.e. a client not meant to be used from the shell of your favorite exotic Unix distribution), are still rare and there just aren’t that many best practices in place yet. Existing best practices for front end development are for centralized apps and a lot of them go right out the window when you introduce the challenges of decentralized data retrieval.Decentralization is important though and, in my humble opinion, is here to stay. Over time, we’ll get there. Client developers will continue to come up with clever solutions and P2P libraries and browsers will iterate and improve. Similar to how email clients have come from being limited to the engineering labs of universities to now being used by your Grandma on her iPad, decentralized computing is coming soon to a grandma near you.",

                "content": "by Jason Hotelling, OpenBazaar Front End DeveloperHello! We hope you’re having a great time selling and sharing on the OpenBazaar platform.OpenBazaar stores boast the fastest setup time of any ecommerce platform. With very little effort, you can set up your store and add listings in minutes. Then, a little extra work can give buyers an exceptional experience to make them want to visit again and again.Today we are going to talk about how to use tags and categories to help users find and browse your store with ease.Before We Get StartedIf you haven’t already, please follow our guides to getting started with OpenBazaar. They contain instructions and tutorials that span from Download through Browsing and Selling.  The Beginner’s Guide to Buying Goods, Services and Cryptocurrency on Openbazaar  If you are new to OpenBazaar, we also recommend watching our OpenBazaar 2.0 Tutorial on YouTube.    Step 1: Tags Are for SearchTags are one of the things search engines use to determine which listings to show to a potential buyer. Most users will discover your store through a listing that they find in search. For example, if a user is looking for t-shirts, they first navigate to the Discover tab in OpenBazaar. Then they will select a search provider and enter a search term such as “t-shirt” or “t shirt”. In order for potential buyers to find your shirts, you must enter any relevant tags on your listings.In this example, we have entered tags that may match what users enter in Search in the OpenBazaar Discover view.  Tip: Make sure to add your store name as a tag too so when people search for your store name, your listings will show up.Step 2: Categories and Filters in Your StoreOnce users click on your listing, they have the opportunity to visit your store by clicking “Go To Store” in the top left corner. This is where you have an opportunity to hook them and encourage them to shop around more. Your Store View will show potential customers all your available listings.It will make it easier for buyers to shop if you classify your listings. You should take time to become familiar with the Store View browsing experience. It will aid you later in planning and creating your store.Classify Your Listings for Easy Store BrowsingA little planning and foresight can make listing creation much easier. Determine which categories and possible subcategories you’ll support in the beginning.In our example store, Variety Bazaar, we have a wide variety of listings. We ensure a potential buyer can find what they want through useful categories.Enter clear, concise and unique category names for your listings. For our example store, we sell clothing, antiques, comic books and fidget spinners. We decided to represent subcategories within clothing by applying more than one category. We also sell retro items within separate categories. These items are all given the extra category ‘retro’.It is important not to confuse tags with categories. Categories are for organizing your store and providing a simple store browsing experience. They are only used for filtering on the store view.Browsing Using Listing FiltersWhen potential buyers browse your store, they will see a few useful filters to aid them. Understanding these filters will help you plan your store well.Store SearchText entered into this store search filters your listings based only on their titles.ShippingThe Ships to filter limits listings based on countries to which your listings ship.The Free Shipping filter will toggle display of listings based on this option.  Note: This filter displays even if no listings offer free shipping. We encourage you to use it where you can! It makes a purchase more compelling for a buyer if they know they won’t also have to deal with extra shipping costs at checkout.CategoryThe category filter is the primary method for which buyers will hone in on specific types of items.Type New Feature in OpenBazaar Desktop 2.2.5The type filter allows buyers to view store listings based on the current supported types:  Physical Good  Digital Good  Cryptocurrency  ServiceToggle ViewOver on the right side of your store users can toggle between list or grid view. Grid view shows a much larger image providing a better visual shopping experience. This is the default view.In List view your listings are condensed so you can see more of them at one time. Each listing shows a small thumbnail of your product to the left and their prices on the right.  Note: It’s important for your listings to have descriptive titles as well as great photos to draw in buyers.Sort ByThis dropdown menu allows users to sort your store listings based on price or title. Sorting can be by highest to lowest price or vice-versa; alphabetical or reverse-alphabetical.Spend time browsing other stores and take notes on your experience. Once you’re comfortable, its time to ensure your listings reflect a positive experience.  Tip: Once you have a listing or two up, you can clone them to spare yourself from duplicating redundant listing information. Remember to make sure you don’t leave any incorrect fields from the original listing.ConclusionTaking a bit of extra time to plan and set up your store with care is important to drive its success. Achieving discoverability and browse-ability gets buyers in and keeps them around. Relevant tags added to your listings will increase discovery in search. Providing proper categories helps browsing users see what you offer. Finally, being familiar with your buyers’ experience will inform the best listing setup for your store.This is the first in a series focused on getting the most out of your OpenBazaar store experience.

                "title": "The Beginner's Guide to Decentralization", 
                "content": "OpenBazaar is a decentralized marketplace. What does decentralized mean, and why does it matter? This article will explain the concept of decentralization without any technical jargon.Decentralization is a way to describe how a system works. These systems can be nearly anything:  A political system, such as a government  A technical system, such as a computer network  A corporate system, such as the structure of a company  A legal system, such as the laws of a particular nationHere’s a quick definition: decentralized means that no single person or organization has control over everyone else in a given system.To better understand the concept I’ll give you some examples, but first, you need to understand decentralization’s opposite: centralization.Defining Centralized SystemsIf a system is “centralized,” that means one person or organization has control over everyone else. This means that the person or organization in control is able to make decisions on behalf of other people within the system, whether they like it or not. Let’s look at two examples.  A centralized political system is one where one person or organization has control over everyone else and can make decisions for them. Monarchies and dictatorships are examples of highly centralized political systems where the leader of the nation is in control.  A centralized marketplace is one where the owner of the marketplace has control over all their users and can make decisions for them. Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Alibaba and all the popular ecommerce platforms are centralized. These companies get to make and enforce the rules for all the users on their platform, such as taking a cut of every transaction, monitoring all their data, and censoring trade whenever they choose.Centralized systems are permissioned. You need the permission of the person or organization in control in order to participate. In a country with a highly centralized political system, permission must be granted for things like printing newspapers or even traveling. If you try to use a centralized payment system such as PayPal you need their permission. Most social media platforms are centralized and require the permission of the company to use them. Permission can be granted or revoked at any time.This image shows what a centralized system looks like. The participants in the system are on the outside, and there is one person or organization in the middle that everyone else is dependent upon.Centralized network with a central point of controlCentralization has its benefits. It removes ambiguity about who is in control and allows for swift action to remedy problems. For computer networks, it’s much easier to build and maintain centralized systems than decentralized ones. Having a strong leader controlling a company can help keep everyone focused.Centralization also has drawbacks. There may not be ambiguity about who is in control, but that doesn’t mean those in control are actually competent, or moral. Centralized systems are easier to build technically, but they are also more fragile, since they have a single point of failure (if the person / organization in charge is gone, so is the system). Being permissioned means that those in power might exclude people they don’t like or agree with.Centralized systems can change based on who is in control. Even if the system is run well by competent and moral people today, it could be run poorly by different people tomorrow.There is an alternative to having systems so tightly controlled: Decentralization.What Are Decentralized Systems?As we’ve said, decentralized means that there is no single person or organization that has control over everyone else in a given system.Participants in decentralized systems have the ability to make decisions themselves and aren’t forced to rely on anyone who controls the system. Let’s look at two examples.  A decentralized political system is one where no person or organization has the ability to govern everyone else. A completely decentralized political system would be an anarchy (absence of a governing structure). Modern democratic systems have some elements of decentralization, where participants in the system do have some control over the decision-making process and there are multiple organizations which exist to ensure power doesn’t become centralized within one portion of the government.  A decentralized computer network is a system where the computers talk directly to each other and there is no central point of control. Most online platforms today work by having a lot of computers called servers that their users are forced to connect to if they want to use the service. They are centralized and completely control the system. A decentralized computer network has no central servers that control access to the network: each users’ computer connects directly to other users’ computers, making a network of computers that no one controls. OpenBazaar is such a network, as are networks like Bitcoin and Bittorrent.This image shows what a decentralized system looks like. The participants in the system are equal and connect with each other instead of depending on a central party.Decentralized network with no centerDecentralized systems are permissionless. Since no one controls the system, there’s no one who can stop people from joining it nor force them to leave. You can join or leave the OpenBazaar or Bitcoin networks anytime you want to.Decentralization has its benefits. There are no gatekeepers preventing you from doing what you want to do. Decentralized systems offer more freedom than centralized systems. There is no single point of failure which makes decentralized systems more resilient. Since there’s no one in charge there is no one that everyone depends on.Decentralization also has drawbacks. Designing systems that have no one in control is difficult to do, and if not done properly will mean the system won’t work. Being permissionless does prevent gatekeepers from excluding people, but it’s also difficult (or even impossible) to remove bad actors from the system. Decentralized networks also tend to be more difficult to use than their centralized counterparts.The Spectrum of DecentralizationCentralization and decentralization aren’t black and white. It’s not one or the other. Most systems have a mix of centralized and decentralized attributes that fall on a spectrum. When I say “centralized systems” I mean systems that have a clear central point of control. When I say “decentralized systems” I mean systems with no clear central point of control. In practice, there are gray areas.For example, a monarchy is a highly centralized form of governance.  However, there are historical examples of monarchs’ power being constrained by other groups, such as aristocracy or religious groups, so even the most centralized form of governance imaginable isn’t fully centralized in practice.The same is true with decentralized systems. One criticism of “flat hierarchies” within companies (an attempt at eliminating management) is that they remain flat in name only, while some people effectively become managers again over time. Or when computers in decentralized networks communicate peer-to-peer for most communications but are forced to connect to a specific server the first time they start up (called a “bootstrap node”). Maintaining perfect decentralization within a given system is nearly impossible.It’s also true that the same system can have strong decentralized elements and strong centralized elements at the same time. This can happen in open source software projects. The software itself might be built to communicate in a fully decentralized manner, but the development process itself is completely centralized within a small group or even an individual. There are some companies who offer a platform for users which they fully control and is completely centralized, but their corporate structure itself is decentralized. In these cases, you can’t label the entire system centralized or decentralized, but only certain attributes such as governance or technical architecture.The Importance of Decentralization on OpenBazaarOpenBazaar is unique because of its decentralization, but that alone though isn’t what makes it compelling. What’s important about OpenBazaar being decentralized is what it enables users to do.There is no company or organization that runs the OpenBazaar network. It’s a collection of people around the world connecting directly to each other to engage in free trade using cryptocurrencies. This lack of gatekeepers means OpenBazaar is permissionless, has no fees, is private, and has no censorship.  It wouldn’t be possible to have these attributes without being decentralized.If a company controlled the OpenBazaar network then…  It wouldn’t be permissionless, since they could deny access.  It wouldn’t be private, since they could watch users’ actions on their servers.  It wouldn’t be free to use, since they would own the infrastructure and need to take a cut to pay for it.  It wouldn’t be censorship-resistant, since the company would need to control the network based on business and market pressures.ConclusionCentralized and decentralized systems exist on a spectrum and each have pros and cons. No current human system is completely one or the other. One thing they share though is that neither structure is an end goal in itself. What’s important is how these structures enable the participation of all involved parties.OpenBazaar is not compelling just because it’s decentralized. OpenBazaar is excellent because the decentralization of the network gives users incredible freedom, privacy and autonomy in how they buy and sell online.",

                "title": "Troubleshooting and How to Help with The Development of OpenBazaar", 
                "content": "By Mike Greenberg, OpenBazaar Backend DeveloperWhen we use any kind of software we are likely to encounter issues from time to time. With closed-source software, or software that we generally pay for, there’s usually an easy way to contact someone for support as needed. You pay them, they fix your issues and it’s a very closed, one-on-one discussion.But there’s a tradeoff: if that company changes their policies, pumps up their prices, or shuts down, that will have some effect on your ability to get that help—or even keep using the software at all.Open source software is a different kind of animal. It’s the result of many people coming together, sometimes from all around the world, to build programs that are transparent and inclusive, where contribution to the code base is easy and collaborative. This decentralization of technology is a major part of what we love about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin because it’s all about giving power back to individual users and contributors. It allows them to be in control and make decisions for themselves.OpenBazaar is an open source application that is designed to be the fabric of future ecommerce with no middlemen involved and sometimes it presents some unique challenges. As the development leaders of this marketplace, we at OB1 are focused on providing a quality user experience within the app but also want to ensure users are empowered outside of it as well so they can troubleshoot issues and help the platform keep growing. Which brings us to today’s topic…Troubleshooting and Reporting Issues with OpenBazaar! (Cue applause)OpenBazaar not only has the benefit of a company like OB1 ensuring its team is available, transparent and engaged with the community when people need assistance, it also has the communal benefits of an open source project.Being able to navigate the resources of an open source project efficiently could save you time and headaches but may be different than what you’re accustomed to. This post should help clear up the support options that are available when you need help and show you how to give back to the OpenBazaar community at the same time.Let’s dig in.What Just Happened?Uh oh. Your screen is displaying a cryptic error or the thing you expected never happened. Now what? The next steps are important to follow specifically in order to get to the bottom of it.The first thing to do is record the specific error messages you see and/or take screenshots of the problem. This part is critical for the developers to properly identify the root cause. You are an archeologist making an archive of this bizarre behavior and you need to ensure it is preserved perfectly.  Text errors should always be copied and pasted where possible.  Visual anomalies should be screen captured.  Original file output relevant to the failure should be saved.Capturing these artifacts up-front will make sure they don’t accidentally get lost by the application changing state automatically or losing power on your computer.Finding SolutionsNow that you have the details of the problem, we should make sure that someone else hasn’t already reported the problem or found a fix. Often a problem has already been discussed and it’s just a matter of using the right tools to find some answers. As a developer on the project, I usually spend 2-3 minutes searching for unique phrases in the error or picking search terms which are going to identify my problem uniquely from other problems.For example, consider the following error message:The unique parts of this error are error following and the phrase cannot start a transaction within a transaction. Pay extra attention for developer misspellings if you’re transcribing an error from a screengrab too. While misspellings are embarrassing, they may occur sometimes. Pasting these search phrases into your search engine of choice should reveal pretty quickly if anyone else has reported this issue yet. Making use of double-quotes around phrases which should match exactly is recommended to filter out unrelated results.A search for OpenBazaar “error following” produced a Github issue which was reporting the same error. However, when we open the issue we find that the cause of the error is due to something different and probably not related to our problem. I will leave a search for the other phrase as an exercise for you to try. Finding a discussion around an existing problem could lead to a solution that you might be able to apply yourself.Researching ResourcesIf a solution doesn’t already exist, you will need to get your new problem report into the right hands. We have quite a few places across the internet where the OpenBazaar community offers help to each other. Take advantage of the open community by sharing your challenge in the appropriate channel.Let’s quickly walk through the common resources available and how they may be useful.1) Frequently Asked Questions and Knowledge BaseHere we keep instructions for common tasks such as software setup, establishing your store, and handling moderation tasks. There’s also information about features which are unique to OpenBazaar like our multi-signature escrow or how vacation mode is used. This is primarily a read-only site which will surface the most regular questions from our users.2) Active Updates on TwitterTwitter can be a good source of up-to-the-minute news as well as a way to reach out to our team for urgent requests. Here you can find dialogue with fans, critics, news, updates, and promotions from our marketing team. It is an open platform for discussion with a short-form approach to dialogue.3) Community Discussion on RedditReddit allows for topical, threaded discussions and lets users discuss all sorts of things. Some leading topics in the OpenBazaar subreddit include: new stores, decentralized ecommerce news, cryptocurrency mechanics and issues which are hard to track down. The discussion on Reddit shifts over time but its persistence gives a good archive of past issues and thought-provoking conversation. Participating in the OpenBazaar subreddit can be anonymous and has no barrier to posting a question or comment short of creating a Reddit account. Most anything even slightly related to OpenBazaar can be posted here.4) Real-time Discussion on Slack and TelegramFor high-bandwidth conversation with other users and contributors, our team and community congregate in these 2 discussion forums that function a lot like real-time chatrooms. Some areas of these communities focus on 3rd party search providers, moderators and escrow, and new ideas being tested on OpenBazaar, as well as offering each other help and support on common issues. Slack, by far the more popular of the two, has the most regular activity, as the OB1 team and many other developers are engaged there. Telegram is not quite as active but is a nice addition to Slack were people can pop in to ask quick questions about OpenBazaar or determine their next steps troubleshooting an issue.5) Development on GithubGithub contains the technical discussions and objectives of our various projects. Each repository contains a history of commits from previous contributors, a list of issues that represent pending work, and in some cases further technical documentation which is coupled to the software. This is where the rubber meets road as far as where improvements are discussed and added. It’s safe to assume if a problem or issue is not being tracked in Github, it is not being worked on.Reporting The ProblemOkay, so what happens when you have exhausted all avenues of personal research and are still stumped? OB1 funnels all code changes through Github’s issue tracker. When providing a bug report, including enough information in order to reproduce–and then fix–the problem is the primary objective.Here is a brief checklist of useful information that should be included in the report:      Mention your operating system (OS) and version. If the OS type and version is unknown for your computer, you can visit http://whatsmyos.com to help. (ex: Windows 10, MacOS 10.12.16, Ubuntu 16.04)        Mention your OpenBazar software version. This is indicated in the top right corner of the About screen, which can be launched from the navigation menu in the upper right. (ex: client 2.2.4, server 0.12.3)        Share any specific error messages and screenshots you have previously recorded.        Describe any context or steps leading up to the error. A bug may be unique to the original environment it was created in or it may only be triggered by following steps in a specific order. Developers will use this information to attempt to reproduce the error in a controlled environment. Only once the problem can be demonstrated can developers begin to isolate and repair the root cause.        Clearly indicate what you expected to happen. The error you’re experiencing may not be completely obvious to the developer that is reading your report. You may consider including your reason for wanting the problem to be solved the way you described. A developer may value this insight for improving the user experience of the feature.  Reporting a bug is as simple as opening an issue in the appropriate Github repository, which will most often be openbazaar-go or openbazaar-desktop. OB1 separates the repositories for the frontend user interface and the backend server. If you are unsure which repository a report should be put into, take a good guess and we’ll fix it if necessary. Once you have the information prepared, you can visit the Issues tab and click “New Issue” and paste the prepared information.What if you don’t have a Github account to report the issue? That’s okay. If you are unfamiliar with Github then you may also file a report using Zendesk.Posting your report in Github is likely to get a faster solution, but you can also share your issue in any of the other official channels mentioned to begin a discussion. Who knows, you might even find another user is having the same issue later and puts both of your reports into Github. Our community IS pretty helpful!Following Up and FixingThere may be some additional questions the team has. Please be sure to check back on your report from time to time to see if progress on your fix is being made and if more information about your problem may be needed.ConclusionReporting an issue to the OpenBazar community can be a bit of work but you can be an active part of finding or even building the solution. Since OpenBazaar is open source software, this is a huge part of how the marketplace grows. By taking the time to share your experiences with OB1 and other community developers you can contribute to making this software better for everyone—and maybe make some friends along the way.If you haven’t already, please make sure you come join us on Slack, our most active community forum, and say hello!",

                "title": "How To Build a Search Engine for OpenBazaar", 
                "content": "by OpenBazaar Lead Backend Developer Chris PaciaWhen we were designing OpenBazaar, now the world’s largest decentralized marketplace, we knew the general approach to creating a search engine that delivered high quality results was to use a centralized server to index listings and run search queries. A centralized search experience, however, was completely out of line with the freedom and flexibility this open-source marketplace represents. We knew there had to be some intermediate step we could take.A Federated ApproachWe decided to do what few other platforms have done and open it up so that anyone can create a search engine that is compatible with the OpenBazaar app. This would allow us to start by building our own search engine to help users navigate the network but would relieve their total reliance on it. All the data that needs to be indexed is public and anyone can create and run a search engine of their own.Building a Search Engine for OpenBazaarI have written a brief overview of how to build a search engine for OpenBazaar and described some of the outstanding issues we are still working on. It does take some technical skill to build a search engine, but developers with previous experience building and maintaining online infrastructure should be able to create a simple version without too much difficulty.Step 1 - Finding PeersStep one is to build a database of all the peers you want index. There are several ways you can do this:1) Actively crawl the networkThe openbazaar-go API provides a couple of APIs to make this easy. /ob/peers returns a list of peers you’re connected to:And /ob/closestpeers/&lt;peerID&gt; returns a list of “closer” peers from the DHT. One can crawl the network for more nodes just by iterating over your current peer database and fetching closer peers.You can also use the /ob/peerinfo/&lt;peerID&gt; endpoint to look at their IP address if you wanted to index only Tor stores, for example.2) Passively listen for new peersFor this you’d likely want several nodes running at the same time. From there you could streampeerIDs to your database every time one of your nodes receives a new connection. You might not get all peers this way but you should find most. openbazaar-go nodes do not expose an API which streams new peer connections so you’d have to patch a node to get this data. Creating such an API should be relatively easy and it’s something we are considering doing.3) Subscribe to pubsubWe are just now starting to make use of the libp2p’s pubsub capabilities. Currently only IPNS data is broadcast to pubsub channels but hopefully relatively soon we will have all nodes announce new publishes over a pubsub channel. Normal users will not be subscribed to this data–as it is a lot of data–but for people who are building search engines this would be perfect.Depending on what data we include in the publish, you should be able to subscribe to the appropriate channel and receive streaming updates from every peer. We’ll be sure to announce and document this functionality when it is available.4) Manual curationYou could also just manually enter the peerIDs of stores you find interesting in your database. This isn’t actually a bad strategy if you want your search engine to target specific types of products. Complex machine learning algorithms would likely also work for this if you are particularly adventurous.Step 2 - Indexing StoresNow that you have a list of stores it’s time to index them. /ob/listings/&lt;peerID&gt; will give you a list of all the store’s listings.And if you grab the hash from a listing you can get the full details by using /ob/listing/&lt;peerID&gt;/&lt;hash&gt;You will also need the user’s profile which you can get from /ob/profile/&lt;peerID&gt;Then you can put the listings in whatever database you please to index and search them. Your API just needs to conform to the specification in OBIP2 and it will be compatible with the client.To see your search engine when your stores are indexed, enter the URL here in the OpenBazaar client:Step 3 - Keeping Content FreshThe biggest challenge with running a search engine is avoiding serving stale content. Given that OpenBazaar is still fairly new, users may come and go frequently. You want to avoid serving listings for stores where the owner has not been online in a long time to make sure to give potential buyers a fresh discovery experience.Further, listings are not guaranteed to persist on the network longer than a week after a vendor has gone offline. It still may be visible to some users due to caching, but not everyone may be able to see the listing. If you serve old listings, a potential buyer might click on it only to get a Not Found error. We recommend not serving listings from vendors which have not been identified as being online at least once within the past week.How do you determine that? Admittedly this is an area where we are still working to improve but there are a few ways.First, make sure your database of peerIDs also tracks the last seen or last good timestamp for the peer. Next, you have several ways you could update the timestamp:1) Ping each peerThe /ob/status/&lt;peerID&gt; endpoint will attempt to ping them and tell you if they are online.The problem, however, is that about 60% of nodes on the network are unreachable due to NAT traversal issues. Tor nodes tend to have even worse issues as many users run on operating systems like Tails and Whonix which lock down the control port and make it difficult to accept incoming connections. So this only gets you part of the way there.2) Passively listen for incoming connectionsThis is similar to 2) above in Finding Peers. You could update the timestamp for a peer every time they connect to you but again this will either require patching your node or for us to provide an API to get the data. This also will not cover every peer you’re interested in unless you run many nodes.3) Disable cachingIf you set \"UsePersistentCache\": false in your node’s config file it will stop returning from cache and will do a new DHT crawl each time you request user data. If the data has dropped out of the network, you will know about it as the data will return not found. If it’s not found, you should generally not serve up that peer’s data.Additionally, you’ll likely also want to set \"BackUpAPI\": \"\" in the config as by default it will try to get the record from our gateway’s cache if the record cannot be found in the DHT.4) Use IPNS record validityEvery time a user publishes new content they publish an IPNS record containing an expiration date in the DHT. That expiration date is the time at which the user’s listings will drop out of the network absent them re-publishing which happens automatically when their node starts up and once a day thereafter.When you query for a user’s listings or profile or anything else, your node looks up the IPNS record. You could theoretically use this expiration date as a proxy for the last good timestamp for the peer and beyond that stop serving their listings.This data is not yet exposed in our API and it’s something that we have on our list to develop.5) Use pubsubCurrently, whenever you query for a peer’s data, it subscribes to streaming updates for that peer. This means you’ll be notified immediately whenever they publish a new IPNS record. Not only does this tell you when they have signed online, but you could also get the latest IPNS record validity.Currently, disabling cache–3) above–also disables pubsub and would make this method ineffective. This is another issue that we are working on improving.Step 4 - Making Money!It’s entirely possible for you to monetize your work on an OpenBazaar search engine by adding paid ads in your search results. In fact, you could pretty easy sell ad space for your search engine through your own OpenBazaar store!Issues and ImprovementsThis is a general overview of the technical work required for building an OpenBazaar search engine. We’re aware of some areas we would like to improve upon such as creating an API that allows us to stream newly found peerIDs and also have APIs that allow us to inspect IPNS records or pubsub publishes to update our timestamp associated with each peer. We could likely combine all of this into one streaming API that pulls data from all these sources and streams not only new peerIDs that it finds, but also the most up-to-date timestamp for that peer that it is able to decipher. This way search engines only need a single API to update their peers database.We are constantly working to make it easier for anyone to jump right in and start building on the OpenBazaar platform.

                "title": "Decentralized Search and Content Discovery on OpenBazaar", 
                "content": "by OpenBazaar Developer Tyler SmithContent discovery is a crucial component to any ecommerce system, especially 2-sided marketplaces where users are both the buyers and the sellers. Even if vendors have listed a number of great products, if users can’t find things they want then they won’t become buyers. Centralized 2-sided marketplaces like Amazon and Etsy have been able to build robust discovery tools because they control the platform and are able to collect every bit of user data generated there.A decentralized marketplace like OpenBazaar removes the opportunity for a single organization to own and control all data which creates advantages for users in giving them more freedom and privacy but it also presents some challenges for creating a good content discovery system.A truly decentralized answer to easy and elegant content discovery does not yet exist but we have developed an approach to help buyers find things they want and need in this growing marketplace while still honoring a valuable principle that decentralization provides: choice.Federation: A stop between centralization and full decentralizationIn version 1.0 of OpenBazaar we tried our hand at a truly decentralized search index but the results were less than ideal. The technology is just not there yet. In response to the search deficiencies then, the market acted in the form of DuoSearch, which was a company that decided to build a crawler for the network and maintain their own centralized index. Users had to leave the OpenBazaar app and go to the DuoSearch website to easily browse items. Once they discovered items they wanted to by, they had to return to the app to make the purchase.For version 2.0 we knew we wanted a system that could be as nice to use as DuoSearch, from inside the app, and without requiring all users to use a single, centralized search engine. The solution is a federated search system that anybody can participate in. In version 2.0, each search provider can build and maintain their own view of the network but conform with a common interface that allows them to be used interchangeably in systems. Nobody has an upper hand and everybody can compete on quality and features.Basics of building a search API for OpenBazaarAnybody can build a search provider that can be added to the client by ensuring their API is compliant with OBIP2 which defines a spec for how the OpenBazaar client and search providers interact. Any API following the spec can be consumed by OBIP2 clients which means anybody can build their own search engine any way they’d like to. They show any listings they want, any filters they want, and score results any way they want.In order to serve search results a, search developer needs to crawl the network using the OpenBazaar server API and index the results into a system like Elasticsearch or Algolia. They also need to frequently re-check their data to ensure the content is still available on the network.After indexing all the data they need to build an API satisfying the OBIP2 interface so that OpenBazaar users can add the root URL to their client and begin using the search engine.Customizing your search experienceA search provider could be completely free for use, monetize their search by selling paid promotion slots, or sell premium search endpoints. It’s entirely up to them how they’d like to run it.Every provider decides what results to show for any given query and they define their own filtering and sorting options. This allows them do things like experiment with new features or specialize in only certain types of listings.Someone could create a food-oriented search where users can filter by types of food or ingredients and sort by nutritional value. Or a search engine for clothing with options related sizes and styles. The OpenBazaar protocol and applications have no concern for what data is being served, as long as it’s being served in the proper format for users to access.Common issues and future improvementsCrawling the network and keeping the data fresh is the most challenging part of building a search provider. Search providers want to make sure everything they serve is still available on the network. They also don’t want to serve listings whose names have expired on the network which can be tricky to track.In the future we plan to make this much easier and more reliable by utilizing PubSub in IPFS to broadcast updates that anybody can listen for. Providers will only need to listen on the update channel to get all the information necessary to update their index.We’re aware that the tooling and documentation around the lower level details on how to build a working crawler could stand to be improved. We are working on a future post that goes into more technical details and explanations and are considering how we can create open tooling to make it as easy as possible for anybody to participate in the OpenBazaar content provider ecosystem.",

                "content": "Hello and welcome! We’re glad you want to buy goods, services and cryptocurrency on OpenBazaar.You can start by casually browsing what’s available in this decentralized marketplace at openbazaar.com. When you’re ready to buy, this handy guide will show you how you can set up an OpenBazaar profile, step by step. It only takes a few minutes!If you have any difficulties along the way, please visit our Support page for ways to get in touch with us and let us know. If you want to chat with someone from the OpenBazaar community for help, or to give feedback on how OpenBazaar is working for you, join our Slack community.Step 1 – Download and Install OpenBazaarMost users will want to download the package that matches their operating system from our website at openbazaar.org/downloadIf you have some technical expertise and want to manually install OpenBazaar, read these instructions.Step 2 – Run OpenBazaarThe first time you run OpenBazaar you will be guided through a short onboarding process to setup and personalize your node.Your OpenBazaar node is similar to an account or profile on a traditional website but with an important difference: you own it.With websites, you create your user account on a server that someone else, like Amazon or Ebay, owns entirely. This is kind of like renting an apartment in a building that they own. When you are “leasing” space on a regular website this way, they control how you access it, too. They give you “keys” that you use to access your account–your login and password–and they can also revoke them at any time.With OpenBazaar, you create and own your own server–your node!–that participates in the marketplace network, and all data you create lives on your own computer. This is like building your own independent house that has a private entrance only you can find so no login or password are necessary.Since your node and profile live entirely on your own computer, someone would have to access your computer directly in order to make changes to it or take it down. This is more secure than how websites operate though it requires a little bit more knowledge to manage. For example, if you want to access your profile from another computer, you have to move all of your files to that other computer. To “close” your account, you simply delete your files from your computer following these instructions.We are working to make this more flexible in the future so that you have the option to set up your profile or store to be accessible from various devices.Onboarding SetupHere you go! Time to Get Started.First you will be asked to set up your integrated cryptocurrency wallet. Right now this includes Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Zcash (beta). At this time you can only select one to start but if you would like the option to shop with more of the available currencies you can add additional wallets after this first setup which is described later in this tutorial.Then you will be asked a few questions such as your name, description of your profile/store, country, and preferred display currency.You also have the opportunity to upload an avatar for your profile. Click on Select Avatar to choose a file from your computer. Recommendations here are to choose a nice, uncomplicated avatar that scales well into a circle frame as it will appear around the application. Avatars should be a square at least 280px by 280px or larger for best visual appearance.Then there is a disclaimer about using the OpenBazaar software, which you should read before continuing because OpenBazaar is an unique and new kind of marketplace.Finally, you will see a screen asking you to opt into optional analytics collection. This is your choice and even if you change your mind you can always opt in or out again at any time in your Settings.After finishing onboarding, you’ll now see your own OpenBazaar Store page. Each user has their own profile and store on the OpenBazaar network by default but if you are just joining as a buyer you don’t need Click on Home in the menu near the top to see your regular profile page and make changes as you’d like.Step 3 – Search &amp; BuyTo browse items, click the OpenBazaar tent icon to the right of the address bar at the top of your client window to Discover.You will see the Discover bar at the top which shows the integrated search engines you can use to browse items. It defaults to OB1, which is underlined. OB1 is the company leading the development of OpenBazaar and we have built our own search engine to help users navigate the network. We will be walking through this search engine only in this overview. Other search engines built by third parties may also be integrated &amp; some may be available here.Below that is the search bar where you can search for keywords and terms you may want to see like shirt or art. This search pulls from the keyword tags that sellers add to their listings and not the titles, descriptions or store names at this time. For best results sellers are encouraged to add all the relevant tags they can think of to help buyers find their items.You can also choose from the Suggestions just below the search bar to browse.Below the search bar on the left side are different criteria you can use to help search &amp; sort listings to your preferences. By default the Accepted Currency will match the currency you selected for your wallet on setup so it’s easier to see items available that you can pay for using your OpenBazaar wallet. You are able to change this setting to browse other items available but you will not be able to pay for them unless you set up an additional wallet supporting that currency.Make a purchaseWhen you find something you’d like to purchase, click BUY NOW.The order process is a 4 (sometimes 5) step process that begins when you click BUY NOW.This initiates the purchase channel that you then can choose to Fund by sending your coins. If you simply click Buy and do not Fund a purchase, no coins are transferred and it functionally becomes a cancelled order.The next phases of the purchase may include Accepted then will always have Fulfilled and Complete. The Accepted action must be completed by the seller to open the payment connection if required.When the seller sends your order they will then set the status to Fulfilled. Then you must Complete the order and leave a review when your purchase has been completed.Payment Types in OpenBazaarThere are three types of payments in OpenBazaar:  Direct payments - Coins are sent directly from the buyer to the seller.  Moderated payments - Coins are sent to a 2-of-3 multisignature account that works like escrow. A third party moderator, who is another regular user type within OpenBazaar, is added to this kind of transaction to help in case of a dispute.  Offline payments - when a seller is offline, coins are sent to a 1-of-2 multisig address that they can accept when they return.Read more about how the different payment types work here.WalletsYou can use an external cryptocurrency wallet to pay for listings or use the integrated wallet by sending funds to it first. Click Receive Money and either send coins from a mobile wallet using the QR code or copy and paste the text address below into your your desktop wallet.Setting Up Additional Coin Type WalletsDid you find something that you would like to buy but that requires a different type of cryptocurrency wallet than your node has? At this time additional wallets can be added by creating additional nodes you can easily toggle between on your computer.Simply hover over your avatar in the top right corner and then your store name. Click the option New Server. This will take you to a module where you can select the new type of node you’d like to set up.After setup, you can then quickly toggle between your nodes by doing basically this same thing again: hovering over your avatar, then your store name, then selecting your additional nodes from the menu that pops up.Want To See More?Check out this video tutorial of the OpenBazaar setup process which is a bit older but still shows a lot of the basics in action:    Talk To Us!We hope this guide was helpful for getting started using OpenBazaar.

                "title": "IPFS & Libp2p Developer Meetings - Growing The Decentralized Tech That Helps OpenBazaar Work", 
                "content": "By OB1 Lead Backend Developer Chris PaciaThis month I had the opportunity to attend the IPFS/Libp2p Developer Meeting in Berlin. IPFS development is of great importance to us as OpenBazaar is built on top of it and relies heavily on it for most of its functionality. Overall the meeting was very productive. It was nice to meet the new members of the Protocol Labs team and see how they are growing. They have an enormous amount of talent on their team and in the IPFS community and they’re genuinely solving very hard problems in decentralized web development.Here are some of the key takeaways from this event as they relate directly to OpenBazaar:QUICThey’ve been able to integrate QUIC as a transport for IPFS. For those who don’t what QUIC is, it’s a new transport created by Google which offers all around better performance than TCP. Not only will QUIC make OpenBazaar faster, but it will help slightly with NAT traversal.IPNS PubsubPubsub isn’t yet hooked up in the IPFS coreapi package but will be shortly. While we will still need to make a DHT crawl the first time an IPNS query is made as well as when coming back from absence, all subsequent queries will return the most up-to-date record instantly. We should see a nice speed boost in browsing as a result.NAT TraversalI learned that IPFS is already doing more for NAT traversal than I realized but more work is still needed. Currently a high percentage of nodes on the IPFS network are not reachable and I presume it’s probably a similar percentage of OpenBazaar nodes. We had some nice discussion about improving NAT traversal. The first action item is to wire up the libp2p-autonat package which will help detect if users are behind restricted NATs. Moving forward we’d like to develop some heuristics for deciding if and how to relay packets through other nodes using the libp2p-circuit-relay.New onion-transportThey’ve done some preliminary work on a new onion transport for libp2p. Our current transport was written by me and will at minimum need to be changed to conform to planned changes to the transport interface. I believe the goal, however, will be to have the new transport ready by the time that new interface goes live so we can easily make the switch. There’s also a possibility we can use a library which statically compiles the Tor daemon and maybe resolve some issues running OpenBazaar on Tails and Whonix.There was plenty more talked about and presented, some of which will likely be in OpenBazaar under the hood but also plenty of projects that are genuinely interesting in the own right.We’ll look forward to seeing everyone again for IPFS conference in Lisbon in November.",

                "content": "OpenBazaar version 2.2.2 was just released, and this update gives users several new improvements to the cryptocurrency trading feature. This release also includes other improvements and bug fixes; for full details read the release notes posted below.Cryptocurrency tradingThis release includes two major improvements to the cryptocurrency trading feature within OpenBazaar.The first is the ability for users offering to trade coins to mark up or discount their price. Instead of only being able to offer a trade at market price, they can choose to add a markup, which will automatically increase the price to the buyer based on the percentage they choose. They can also choose to offer a discount from market price.The software constantly is updating the market price of the cryptocurrencies involved in the trade, and will add the markup or discount at the moment the trade happens.The second improvement to cryptocurrency listings is a major expansion of how many coins can be bought and sold on the platform. Previously there were about 60 available. Now we’re integrated price data from CoinMarketCap and there are more than 1,500 coins you can trade on OpenBazaar.If you want to see if a specific coin is available, download OpenBazaar and start the process of creating a cryptocurrency listing. You’ll see the full list of coins in this dropdown menu:As always, there are no fees to pay and no accounts to sign up for. It’s a direct swap of cryptocurrencies between you and the other party, and if you choose a moderated payment (highly recommended) then there’s a third party available in case of dispute.If you want to buy or sell coins without fees or without signing up for an account, give OpenBazaar a try and let us know what you think.Release NotesThis is a minor release, focused on adding improvements to cryptocurrency listings, such as the ability to set their price above or below the market.New Features  The ability to adjust the price of a cryptocurrency listing by a percentage relative to the market is now available. #1416, #1438  A view on web feature was added to several screens. This provides a link to the same data on openbazaar.com. #1403, #1413, #1430, #1441Improvements  The name of each address in the settings modal is now bold. #1459  The order of the items in the nav menu was adjusted, and your name is now clickable. #1459  New details were added to the opt-in metrics. #1440, #1446  The trumbowyg text editor will now be translated if it has the required language files. #1436  Moderators that don’t use the same cryptocurrency as the user cannot be added as a moderator. If they were already added, they will be marked as invalid so they can be removed. #1420  Non-translated text is now translated. #1392, #1382, #1435  When a cryptocurrency order is fulfilled, the tx sent by the seller can be clicked if it is a URL. If HTML is included in the data, the HTML is removed. The data is validated to not be more than 512 characters. #1386, #1396, #1397  A script to download and implement new cryptocurrency data for cryptocurrency listings was implemented. This is run manually before each release. #1384, #1422, #1423, #1429, #1479Bug Fixes  A rare problem where the debug log can have an error has been corrected. #1480  A new node will now have a default value of 0 for their reviews instead of showing an error. #1477  A bug preventing a user from looking at their own moderator details modal has been fixed. #1473  The memo in a purchase will no longer be cleared on a screen rerender. #1467  When an order times out, but has not been fulfilled, when the seller claims the payment the buyer will no longer be told they can complete the order. #1463  A potential race condition in the order details screen was corrected. #1452  Some minor issues with disputes when only one party’s contract has been received by the moderator were cleaned up. #1448  BCH QR codes will not always have the proper prefix. #1418  A problem with the shipping option selection resetting when interacting with the purchase page was corrected. #1402, #1442, #1447  An issue with the free shipping tag not being horizontally aligned in the store screen was fixed. #1385InternationalizationWe are actively translating the text in the OpenBazaar reference client.

                "title": "Freedom To Trade Means Freedom To Choose Currencies: The OpenBazaar Multiwallet", 
                "content": "OpenBazaar is the most free marketplace available on the planet. That freedom implies choice: the right to choose who to trade with, to choose how to protect your purchase, or to choose the visibility of your listings. That freedom should also extend to your choice of currency. And more than that! For your choice to be independent of any one developer’s motives, including OB1. This is the first of two posts which share the motivation and direction our team will take as we explore how to make OpenBazaar work with any currency users choose.Why The Wallet?Right around the time OpenBazaar 2.0 launched, Bitcoin – the default payment option of OpenBazaar at the time – was experiencing high transaction volume lasting several months resulting in network congestion and a poor user experience. All of this created significant friction during a small window where many first impressions would be established. With the landscape of growing alternative cryptocurrencies simultaneously booming around Bitcoin’s shortcomings, it punctuated the need for a choice in payment inside OpenBazaar.Seeking Currency NirvanaMaking OpenBazaar capable of trading with multiple simultaneous currencies affects many aspects of the application: the Seller and Moderator both have concerns for the types of currencies they can accept on the network; the Buyer has concerns in the refund scenarios; the Wallet implementation manipulates the state of the ledger with the current currency’s representation in mind; there are concerns for the protocol in how certain listings shall be validated; and many screens of interface which need to be reconsidered. With lot of ground to cover, we needed a solution in user’s hands with the least development effort required.A solution was devised that many wallet implementations (along with their respective currency’s representations) would be provided along with the application and the user would be able to select one on startup. The additional options for currency usage would include Bitcoin Cash and Zcash and would make the application’s active currency interchangeable while touching very few of the related details. A seamless experience for the user with just a restart between each currency in use. Only a few screens in the interface would need a change to represent the currently active currency. The server would allow each configuration to be maintained side-by-side facilitating the simple switching from one currency to another without needing to break any of the previously made design decisions.In January 2018, OB1 released version 2.1. This release was a half-step which allowed our team to quickly respond to the unexpected market conditions, but it also created many new challenges. The release proved that the option of other currencies were welcome and being requested on the network. At the time of publishing this article, 12% of crawlable listings have selected Bitcoin Cash as the accepted currency. But it also educated us on the limitations of adopting third-party wallets as we attempted to support multiple contributions; each presenting their own technical and social challenges.When the OpenBazaar wallet was designed, we assumed quite a few time-saving details. The biggest of these assumptions was that Bitcoin would be the only currency in use. This, of course, had side-effects in our design such as a ledger which only tracks UTXO-based currencies as well as displaying values in other currencies from values represented in Bitcoin. We also made the assumption that users would prefer wallets which could independently verify their own transactions as a matter of ensuring the user need not trust the protocol or even the UI. As such, our wallet implementations default to using Simple Payment Verification (SPV) to ensure the user’s own transactions are highly unlikely to be invalid with the option for users to operate full Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash nodes if they preferred.Many of these design decisions needed reconsideration. The maturing mobile experience which the OB1 team was exploring in the background needed a better solution and the existing 2.0 desktop experience was certainly ready to see a simpler interface when using multiple currencies. The existing answer would have lead toward running an SPV wallet (or full node) for each currency simultaneously, but would not scale in resource-constrained environments such as mobile and older-generation computers. OB1 is also integrating Ethereum as a currency for trade on the network and this has highlighted limitations in our UTXO-based ledger and wallet interface.Formalizing the MultiwalletNeeding to make a decision with some urgency, internal discussion landed us on a solution in pursuit of an API backend driving interactions on the blockchain. Each API would handle the concerns for handling their respective currency’s blockchain which would reduce the responsibility of the OB1 team in maintaining currency-specific logic. Users would no longer need to provide the computing resources for transacting on the currency’s blockchain at the expense of the API operator (currently OB1, but more on this later).The APIs of the existing currencies that we already support abstract nicely into our existing wallet-interface with a minor change of adding an additional dimension to a few of the requests (so the wallet knows to which currency’s blockchain a transaction should be applied). With only very minor technical concerns that seemed solvable, the biggest obstacle was that we were sacrificing the user’s default expectation that they can trustlessly engage with their built-in wallet without any other alternatives. Still an imperfect solution for the security-conscious, but a good next step toward supporting multiple simultaneous currencies.  Want to see more? Click here for an interactive demo!We expect that different use cases will change the user’s expectations of the wallet. For example, a vendor might care more about the verifiability of their transactions than a buyer, and a mobile user may prefer to utilize an API-based wallet to save on limited device resources. It would be difficult to build the ideal wallet for all of our users.Further, the OB1 team is committed to seeing OpenBazaar as a protocol of trade which is agnostic of the currency it uses for trade. Any time invested into wallet maintenance is only distracting us from our goals. This was made painfully obvious by the questions raised when the third-party wallet contributions began rolling in. It was unclear who would provide a fix when a bug compromises funds in a user’s wallet. Or decide when a wallet implementation was valuable enough to offer as an option. Nor did we want to be the ones conjuring arbitrary rules for approval.Then, the obvious question was asked: How could we offer the choice of currency and wallet directly to the user? More on that in an upcoming post!",

                "title": "Zcon0 Recap - A 3-Day Look at the Zcash Community and the Future of OpenBazaar Governance", 
                "content": "The Zcash Foundation held their first major conference since inception, called Zcon0, in Montreal at the end of June. I was able to attend and wanted to briefly give my own recap.Zcash is one of the three cryptocurrencies that are currently accepted inside OpenBazaar. Their focus on financial privacy aligns with the goals of OpenBazaar as a platform where people can choose how private they want their transactions to be.The Zcash Foundation is a relatively young organization, formed to take a leadership role in the Zcash community which has primarily been guided by the Zcash Company. OpenBazaar and OB1 are in a similar situation, where the OB1 company has been leading development on OpenBazaar for years, and we’re now looking to create an OpenBazaar Foundation to move stewardship of the project into a more community-focused nonprofit organization. Part of my interest in attending Zcon0 was to see a community going through an organizational change and see what issues presented themselves and what I could learn.This was my first trip to Montreal. Everyone says it’s a beautiful city, and they’re right. I arrived the day before the conference and visited Mont Royal, a large hill with a park and a stunning view of the city. My phone’s camera doesn’t quite do it justice.Day 1The director of the Foundation, Josh Cincinnati, was unable to attend for family reasons, but he kicked off the conference with a humorous and thoughtful pre-recorded message (and several of these were presented throughout the conference) welcoming us.Zooko spoke next, discussing the general state of Zcash and the company, as well as diving into financial details. I was surprised at how open he was with these details. It set the tone of being honest and open with each other about how things really stood in the Zcash community.Other speakers gave a history of how Zcash came to exist, and then discussed where it was going, with special emphasis on the next big update (named Sapling) coming in the fall.Perhaps the most valuable presentation that morning was “Using Zcash” by Linda Naeun Lee. She was tasked with trying to buy things with Zcash and reporting on her experience. Though she has a computer science background, she wasn’t familiar with the world of cryptocurrency, and she found it a very confusing experience. Zcash simply doesn’t have good wallets, nor does it have good places to spend the coins either.However, Linda did take some time to explain one positive experience she had spending Zcash: on OpenBazaar! She explained how she used OpenBazaar to buy a tshirt for someone in Venezuela with Zcash. I was glad to see OpenBazaar working for its intended purpose.The afternoon was workshops. We got to choose which workshops we attended, and I chose ones on improving user experience and how to achieve wallet scalability. I was able to contribute some thoughts on the UX discussion based on my experience with OpenBazaar, but mostly listened to much more technically knowledgeable people in the wallet scalability discussion. The workshops were intended for the leaders of the sessions to come away from them with new ideas or poll the groups for their opinions on specific issues; I’m not sure they achieved those goals in such a relatively short period of time.Day 2The second day was focused on the technical side of Zcash development. I’m not a developer, and while I’m fairly knowledgeable about how Bitcoin is designed, how distributed networks work, and with the rudimentary basics of cryptography, the majority of these presentations were beyond my grasp.ZK-SNARKS are interesting - as best I can understand them! - and I appreciated that they also had presentations from other similar efforts, such as the Coda Protocol and Bulletproofs.This day was mostly me following presentations for the first ten minutes and then losing the speakers entirely when they started discussing the math or code. Still, I got a general sense for who was working on what, and why they were doing so.That night there was a “Gala Dinner” for attendees. Zooko and Matthew Green had an informal chat with each other on stage while the audience tossed out some conversation ideas. It was a nice idea, but the conversation was unfocused and largely consisted of off-the-cuff personal opinions instead of well-considered thoughts on issues people wanted to hear discussed. But with good food and good company everyone seemed to be having a good time.Day 3This day was devoted to governance, the issue I was most interested in, and I’m glad they took the time to focus on it. They were looking to fill two board seats in the foundation and they explained the voting process they used and their rationale for their approach. The results of the voting were revealed, and it wasn’t only for the board seats, they also asked community members questions about direction of the project.A few members of the group questioned whether or not this voting system was truly representative of the Zcash community as a whole. It was acknowledged that the system wasn’t ideal, but that it was better than the known alternatives.Eric Meltzer briefly spoke and proposed creating an investment fund from the founder’s reward. The presentation itself wasn’t particularly notable, but his idea was proposed in the Zcash forums as well, and the thread was soon locked by a Zcash company employee, creating some drama in the community over the past few weeks. It seems like most people are against changing the founder’s reward, but they also are against the Zcash Company controlling the platforms where people discuss these ideas. I believe efforts are underway to transition these forums’ moderation to the Zcash Foundation now.A speaker gave an illuminating overview of where the foundation had given out grants the year before, and where it was looking to give out grants in the future.The morning session ended with a panel on governance with Peter Van Valkenburgh, Jill Carlson, Zooko Wilcox, Jameson Lopp, and Vitalik Buterin. There were some disagreements on what proper governance entailed, with Jameson favoring a more anarchic position like Bitcoin. Zooko spoke of his concept of consent, which wasn’t perfectly clear to me; it sounded essentially like “take it or leave it” and everyone voting with their feet.The conference wrapped up, and I Ieft Montreal with a better understanding of Zcash from several perspectives: historical, technical,  and communal, as well as a better idea of what they hope it can become moving forward. I was encouraged to see people thinking deeply about the differences between the company and nonprofit organizations and what roles they should be playing.If you want to watch some of the presentations from Zcon0, check out this playlist on Youtube.I appreciate the opportunity to attend and I plan on attending next year.",

                "title": "The Difference Between Cryptocurrency Payments and Cryptocurrency Trading in OpenBazaar", 
                "content": "Cryptocurrencies are very exciting to us, which we think we’ve made pretty apparent. We did, after all, build the world’s first fully decentralized marketplace to help cryptocurrency users find each other and buy and sell goods and services anywhere in the world using this groundbreaking new kind of money.  While the “currency” part of cryptocurrency is particularly important to us, there are quite a few things other you can do with this technology, too.Another important attribute they have is how they store and move value even when not measured against things like physical items or government-controlled currencies. With OpenBazaar we’ve been working hard to help users to do more things with the cryptocurrencies they love which now includes trading coins as well as buying things, both completely peer-to-peer. These two particular features are distinct though and we wanted to tell you a bit more about how they work.Cryptocurrency Payments in OpenBazaarRight now, sending and receiving payments for listings in OpenBazaar can be done with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Zcash (this integration is in Beta). These payments require that both the buyer and seller have wallets running the same coin.Users can choose which of these 3 coins they would like to run when they first set up their profile and/or store. If they would like to add additional coins they can easily set up additional profiles/stores to do so that are easy to switch between.Setting Up a New Server Node Wallet on OpenBazaarThey can also choose to add funds to their OpenBazaar wallets using any other coin they may have in an external wallet as enabled by the Shapeshift Shifty Button integration. The coins will change and resolve to whichever of the 3 integrated coins the wallet is set to.On the development side, integrating additional coins for payments like these 3 coins are is complicated to add and maintain with the current infrastructure. OpenBazaar requires that coins have certain technical attributes to be compatible with the checkout flow, they must have their own separate wallets within OpenBazaar, and users must run separate OpenBazaar nodes in order to support them.  While we’ve made it easy to set up &amp; toggle between different nodes running these different coins, we know this setup is far from ideal.Why is it set up this way?This setup is the result of a choice we made to bridge a gap that opened up with Bitcoin when network transaction fees jumped very high at the end of 2017. We integrated Bitcoin Cash and Zcash quickly because of their technical similarity to Bitcoin, their supportive community and the ease of their implementation just to give users a couple more payment options that could allow them to circumvent these high fees if they wanted to.Our plans now are to phase the network into a more inclusive structure starting with first combining these 3 payment coins into just one wallet. This multicoin wallet will allow users to easily use multiple coins at once rather than in separate nodes.The long term goal is to expand the interface allow for any individual user to easily decide and set up whatever payment coins they would like to use.Cryptocurrency Trading in OpenBazaarCryptocurrency trading is a completely separate feature from the payment coins available in OpenBazaar. It’s enabled by a custom listing type that makes it easy for users to list and search for they coins they want to sell and buy. Users can buy and sell a variety of other coins but again, right now, they must use Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Zcash for the actual payments.Right now OpenBazaar uses third parties to pull in token information for our cryptocurrency trading. We started with BitcoinAverage which provides 44 different coins users can list. Soon we will also be adding CoinMarketCap’s index which will shoot the available coins up to over 1,500. All coins available on these two platforms will also be available in OpenBazaar for trading. In the future we will also be able to add individual coins and we will soon be sharing a process for getting your coin listed if it is not already available through these providers.See how it works on OpenBazaar.com!Now that you’re an expert in the existing structure of payment coins vs. trading coins, perhaps you’d be interested in what our development team is doing next with Ethereum?If you’re ready put your cryptocurrencies to work, download OpenBazaar now!",

                "title": "Valuing Privacy & still Getting Data from a Decentralized Network", 
                "content": "Facebook knows exactly how many users are on their platform. Amazon knows exactly how many products are sold. Instagram knows exactly how many photos are shared.In contrast, no one knows how many people use Bitcoin. No one knows how many files have been shared over Bittorrent. No one knows how many trades happen on OpenBazaar.Why can some networks give precise statistics about how they’re being used, while others can only give estimations or have no data at all? It comes down to the architecture of the networks.Centralized NetworksIf you build a centralized network – and you control the center of the network – you then have access to information about everything that is happening. Centralized systems require all users to connect to a central point of control, and whoever sits at point of control is able to monitor and collect as much data as they please.Centralized network with central point of controlMost platforms on the internet today are centralized, and the central point of control is managed by a company. This is how Facebook, Amazon, and most platforms operate. Those companies sit in the center and collect as much information as they can about their users.On the positive side, this allows them to have precise statistics and answer specific questions about how their platform is being used, which makes it easier for them to improve and satisfy users’ needs.On the negative side, it means the users on centralized platforms have no privacy from whoever manages the central point of control, and they don’t always use the data they gather just to improve their platform. They sometimes sell the data to others, or even lose the data if someone breaks into the databases.Distributed networksDistributed networks are fundamentally different from centralized networks. There is no central point of control in a distributed network. All users in the network are equal to other users, and users connect directly to each other. Each user is running software on their computer which connects them to the network, and that computer is called a “node” in the network.Few platforms on the internet today are distributed, but they are growing in number. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are distributed networks. OpenBazaar is distributed, as is Bittorrent. No one can sit in the center and collect information about users on these networks; there is no center at all.Distributed network with no centerOn the positive side, this means that users have much more privacy on distributed networks. They aren’t required to connect and share information with a central point of control. They connect directly to other peers and exchange information directly, without necessarily informing others on the network about what they’re doing.On the negative side, this makes collecting statistics very difficult, which makes development more difficult. Those building the platform cannot see how users are using their product, and must seek other methods to know how best to improve the product.How Do Nodes Work?Individual users set up and control their own nodes, generally from their own personal computers. They have to allow incoming and outgoing connections to participate in the network and connecting to other nodes takes some time.One of the difficulties in collecting stats from distributed networks is the fact that most nodes on the network will only connect to a handful of peers at a time. If the network has 1,500 nodes running, each individual node might only be connected to eight or ten other nodes, meaning they only see a small fraction of the overall network.This means that getting an overview of the entire network is difficult, and requires lots of nodes that are connected to different peers. Or it requires a method to “crawl” through the network and look at the state over time and not as a single snapshot.Distributed networks also present another difficulty in stats gathering: churn. Nodes can join and leave the network at any time because users can set up or delete their stores at any time. In centralized systems people joining and leaving is simple to notice, since they are either communicating with the central point of control or they aren’t. In distributed networks you don’t see all other nodes simultaneously and won’t know what’s happening on another part of the network. Even if you were able to perfectly capture the state of the network at one moment, it will likely change in the next moment.This is further complicated by distributed networks that don’t require nodes to be running 24/7, such as OpenBazaar (built on IPFS). This is a good thing and was a major feature built into the version 2.0 release  so that sellers’ stores are still accessible and buyers’ orders can still be processed even if the seller is technically offline, but it complicates the stats. Any attempt at gathering information about the state of the network by looking at online nodes only will be missing the fact that these offline users are still a part of the network.OpenBazaar Usage &amp; StatsWe can partially answer some questions about the OpenBazaar network with indirect data. For example, while we don’t know how many trades occur, we can see when a user leaves a review on a completed purchase. This gives us a very broad range to make estimations from, but is imprecise.We try to ascertain node count (the number of computers running the OpenBazaar software), but for the reasons noted above this is difficult. We can only see the number of nodes online and accepting incoming connections (users who have port forwarded), which is a small subset of overall OpenBazaar users.This is a limitation from the developer’s perspective, but it’s a feature from the user’s perspective. We built OpenBazaar to be private and it should remain so for people who value their privacy.Opt-in Stats GatheringWe believe we’ve figured out a way to retain the privacy of OpenBazaar users while still allowing for relevant stats gathering to aid development. In the 2.2.0 release we introduced an opt-in stats gathering feature. Users are asked when they start the app if they’d like to share anonymous statistics with the OpenBazaar development team, and a list of the data shared is displayed. If users decline then no information is shared. If they accept then only the data that’s displayed will be shared.This data has already been helpful to the developers and over time will help us answer many questions that would have been impossible otherwise, due to OpenBazaar’s distributed design. Here are a few numbers we have been able to see over the last couple of weeks:  Over 1,600 opt-ins since launch – Roughly 15% of users running version 2.2.0  Of this segment who opted in, visitors from 103 countries have driven over 4,500 sessions  English is the language chosen by 68% of users who opted in; Russian, German and Spanish are all at 6% eachOpenBazaar is a network that exists for its users and is run by its users. In this marketplace, buyers &amp; sellers have greater control over their experience than in any other marketplace on the planet.

Much of the work we are doing right now is largely untangling some of the technological and psychological knots the infrastructure and assumptions of the last 20 years have made for us all.One of the first and biggest knots we knew had to be untangled for a decentralized marketplace like OpenBazaar to be feasible was a pretty basic service other marketplaces and storefronts have historically provided: dispute resolution.  Think about it: in a decentralized network that’s made only of the individual people that participate in it, and transactions exist only between the people engaged in them, what happens when something goes wrong with an order?Payments in OpenBazaarFor a bit of background, OpenBazaar currently uses 3 different cryptocurrency payment types:  Direct  Offline  ModeratedGenerally, if a buyer trusts a seller they can just send their coins directly to them in a direct payment. If the seller is offline at the time of payment, that creates a slightly different payment type where they just have to claim their coins when they return to their store. (You can read more details about each of these payment types here.)Then there are moderated payments, which is what a buyer can use to send coins to a vendor they do not yet know or trust or to provide an extra layer of security for higher cost transactions.What is a moderated payment?Moderated payments are an important part of the OpenBazaar checkout experience and something that we believe is a valuable application of a unique feature that Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies have: multisignature (multisig) addresses.Multisig addresses work like an escrow account between a buyer and a seller by pulling an objective third party into the checkout process, called a moderator. These addresses require 2 of these 3 parties to agree in order to release the coins at the end of a transaction. Typically transactions just go smoothly between buyers and sellers and a moderator’s help isn’t ever needed, but it sure is nice to know they are there just in case! If something does go wrong, moderators will help figure out who gets the payment coins when the buyer or seller opens a dispute.What is a moderator?Again, a decentralized marketplace means that the entire platform is made up only of people connecting to other people with no large organizations sitting in the middle to dictate how anyone uses the platform–nor step in to provide things like dispute resolution. In a decentralized network, the individual users are each responsible for their own experiences which includes contributing positively to the community by building their business and reputation as well as protecting themselves.Like a buyer or a seller, a moderator is also just another type of user on the OpenBazaar network. Anyone can choose to become one and make their services as a moderator available on the network. And as you may know, since it’s pretty easy to get started on the OpenBazaar network, figuring out which users are more likely to be trustworthy requires a little scrutiny, first.How do I pick a good moderator?As a buyer or seller, it’s important to choose a trustworthy moderator to add to your transactions if you are choosing a moderated payment. Here are some tips for choosing a good moderator and OB1, the company leading the development of OpenBazaar, now has a Verified Moderators program that is integrated into OpenBazaar to help users find someone that OB1 has reviewed who has shown themselves more likely to be trustworthy when helping settle disputes.    Also, it’s always good to check out these scam prevention tips to help you stay safe and smart when buying and selling on OpenBazaar.Choose your own adventureThere are a lot of choices involved in using OpenBazaar, and that’s on purpose. We know it is different from what you may be used to but we are building a marketplace where each user gets to be in control of their own experience with more features and opportunities being built all the time.

                "content": "OpenBazaar version 2.2.0 was released today. For the full list of new features and improvements in this release, check out the release notes at the end of the post.The biggest new feature is the ability to ** buy and sell cryptocurrencies**.Cryptocurrency Trading on OpenBazaar    Vendors are now able to use a special new listing type to sell cryptocurrencies on OpenBazaar. They can choose from 44 different cryptocurrencies right now and more will be added over time. Payment must be settled in whichever coin they have chosen for their OpenBazaar store, either Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, or Zcash.Because OpenBazaar is completely peer-to-peer, this is not an exchange. This new feature doesn’t include an order book with the ability to choose a target price for buying or selling. This new feature only allows people to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other at market prices. It benefits from OpenBazaar’s main advantages; users trading cryptocurrencies on the platform won’t need to pay any fees and they aren’t forced to reveal any identifying information.We’ve released this new feature with the goal of listening to the community about how they believe cryptocurrency trading on OpenBazaar can be improved. We plan to rapidly iterate as we receive feedback from users.Please join us on Slack and Twitter to give us your thoughts on this new feature!Opt-in AnalyticsBecause OpenBazaar has been built with privacy in mind, the development team isn’t able to gain much information about how people use the software. This is good for privacy, but can sometimes hinder development. In order to gain more insight on how OpenBazaar is being used – and how to improve it – we’re introducing an opt-in analytics package. Users who choose to opt in will share non-identifying data with the development team. The list of data being shared is displayed when opening the new release for the first time. Users can start or stop sharing data at any time in their Settings.Release NotesThis is a major release, which adds buying and selling cryptocurrencies, opt in analytics, and many optimizations and bug fixes.New Features– The ability to buy and sell cryptocurrencies was added. The currencies can be sold at market rates. This feature is experimental, and is expected to be rapidly iterated on as we receive feedback from users. #1308– An opt-in analytics package was added. Users are able to choose to share non-identifying data with the development team. This will facilitate identifying bugs and improving the app. Users can start or stop sharing data at any time. #1277Improvements  Norweigan, Polish, and Ukrainian translations reached the 80% translated requirement, and were added as options for the client. #1324  When viewing your sales, unfunded orders will now be hidden by default, since you cannot take action on those orders, and they clutter up the list of orders. You can still chose to view those orders. #1310  Listing card image loads will now cancel when the image card is no longer on the screen. This primarily improves the experience when changing pages in the search results or navigating away from a page of search results that hasn’t finished loading. #1309  Verified moderators are now lazy-loaded. This will speed up startup, and notify the user if the list of verified moderators changes while they are looking at information that will be affected by that change. #1298  Verified moderators are loaded from a Tor endpoint if the user is in Tor mode. #1284Bug Fixes  Blockdozer changed their URL for viewing BCH transactions, the URL used when viewing details of transactions has been updated. #1320  An issue where the no valid moderators error would show on an error at the same time as the no verified moderators message, and with the wrong formatting, was corrected. #1307  A problem where invalid mods would never stop loading was fixed. #1306  Error messages meant for only the purchase flow no longer appear in the settings/store tab. #1306  Some layout issues with moderator cards were corrected. #1300  In the settings/store tab, if a moderator assigned to your store has become invalid, now the only option is to de-select them. #1300  An unused memo parameter was removed from the purchase call. #1314  A minor layout issue was corrected in the transactions list. #1285  The bug where pages stats are changed to zero in the page tabs on the user page when the page settings are updated was fixed. #1287  A layout issue with verified moderators was fixed. #1270  Store pages will now open if one of the listings in them has an unrecognized currency value. #1269InternationalizationWe are actively translating the text in the OpenBazaar reference client. If you are interested in volunteering as a translator, you can sign up here.Special ThanksA special thank you goes out to the many volunteers that provide translations, and to our testers that discovered important issues.",

                "title": "Why Do I Have to Download OpenBazaar?", 
                "content": "To use OpenBazaar right now you need to download and install a program on your computer. This is quite different from other marketplaces, which you access by visiting a website. Why the difference?OpenBazaar is a fundamentally different way to do ecommerce. It’s built to let you take control of your own store &amp; profile and connect with other users without any middlemen involved.What middlemen are involved in traditional ecommerce?When shopping or selling online, users encounters layers of middlemen that provide some convenience, but also force fees on users and tightly control all transactions.  The first layer is the money itself, government currencies such as the Dollar, Pound or Euro. They are produced by individual governments around the world and require exchanges to be translated into another global currency.  The second is banks and credit card companies. These institutions are designed to hold and move these currencies and are also regulated by governments.  The third is payment processors. These are companies like Stripe or PayPal that link your bank account or credit card to others so that you can make payments and send money more easily.  Then finally are marketplaces like Amazon, Ebay or Alibaba. These companies own websites and apps where users can shop. This means they own not only the servers on which all buyer and seller profile information and content lives but also the experience that you are having and all of the data any user generates.To break free of all of these middlemen you have to break free of a lot of infrastructure.And that simply wasn’t possible 10 years ago.The real breakthrough came with development of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. These cryptographic coins open up the first two layers of money itself to allow people to exchange value in a currency that isn’t generated by any government and can easily be used internationally.With OpenBazaar, we wanted to harness this power of Bitcoin and take it a step further, removing layers 3 and 4. Instead of asking people to connect to each other through a website or network that we owned, we wanted to just let users connect directly to each other, exactly how they do with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but with a nice interface that felt like the payment processors and marketplaces they were used to.Getting rid of servers in general isn’t an option as the internet still requires machines that can store and serve information to users all around the world–but they don’t necessarily need to be collected in specific locations, or, more importantly, centrally owned.Servers can be broken down and divided up between the users that participate in a certain network.The OpenBazaar download bundleOpenBazaar is two programs in one:  OpenBazaar server – The server is the back end application which allows OpenBazaar to function. Each user runs a server to connect them to the network and allow them to participate. It can both store and share their own public and private data, and help store and share the public data of others. This is the primary reason you have to download OpenBazaar right now.  OpenBazaar client – The client is the front end application and allows the user to communicate and control the server, similar to a remote control. The client is the visual interface; it’s what you’re looking at when you run OpenBazaar.By default, the OpenBazaar packages and installers will install both server and client locally on your machine. However, you can choose to run just the server elsewhere, such as on a Raspberry Pi or use a virtual private server (VPS).This creates a distributed peer-to-peer network with the power of big, centralized servers but that isn’t controlled by any one company or organization – just a community of people who want to engage in trade directly with each other.Web 3.0 in actionThe next evolution of the web is underway now and this sort of restructuring is what that’s all about. The coming years are about building the technology that eliminates the necessity of existing infrastructures to give a high level of control back to users.People who are doing this work believe in a world where people are able to run their own internet experience for themselves, with a level of privacy and control that was not possible, before.Downloading OpenBazaar is a choice to discover a new way to buy and sell online. It represents a willingness to explore and understand more about how the internet will be structured in the coming years.This download represents choice and ownership and a step out from under the heavy hand of centralized power structures.Do you want to help build this future where individuals are in control? Check out OpenBazaar today.",

                "title": "OpenBazaar 2018 Roadmap", 
                "content": "It’s been a while since we updated the roadmap for OpenBazaar development. The previous roadmap essentially stated: “Get 2.0 finished!” We did that last November, and since then we’ve also released one major update (2.1.1) which allowed people to use Bitcoin Cash and Zcash in addition to Bitcoin. Several smaller but important features have been added as well, including verified moderators, to help stop scammers.The company driving development – OB1 – also raised a series A round of funding. Now that the development team has released 2.0 and has resources to continue building, we’re putting out a roadmap to explain where we think OpenBazaar should go next.As always, this is open source and OpenBazaar is nothing more than a collection of people around the world running this free software. We want input from the community on what you think of this roadmap, and we want your help in achieving these goals as well. More details about how you can give feedback or contribute are at the end of the post.    New PlatformsOpenBazaar has always been a desktop-only experience. Building distributed applications is very difficult to do in a browser and on mobile devices, and it was important to get the protocol right first before we even began working on alternative clients.Our mission has always been to make trade free. No cost to engage in trade, and no restrictions on trade either. To do this we try to make the barriers to entry of the application as low as possible. On desktop, the installation process and store setup are quite simple – but not everyone has a modern computer, and not everyone is able to download, install, and run whatever applications they want.Being able to run OpenBazaar in a browser and on a smartphone is essential to further reduce the barriers to entry into the network. These new clients are going to be the primary areas we focus on over the next year.MobileOur mobile journey initially positioned OB1 offering a hosted node service that the iOS and Android clients would connect to. While convenient for the user, it would require OB1 controlling infrastructure and acting as a gatekeeper for the decentralised marketplace for mobile users.Instead, we approached the Go community in Q3 2017 for assistance in modifying the OpenBazaar server (written in Go) for mobile devices. This strategy was successful, and after some optimisation we are proud to report that the OpenBazaar mobile applications, which OB1 will release, will run a full OpenBazaar node on the device. The significance of this achievement cannot be understated as this enables billions of mobile devices to access a decentralised marketplace as a full node on the OpenBazaar network.At the time we achieved this milestone and were positioned to release the app, Bitcoin transaction fees escalated to the point where trade was only viable for expensive transactions. We decided we needed to integrate other cryptocurrencies, as we further explain in this video.While the OpenBazaar server now supports other cryptocurrencies such as Zcash and Bitcoin Cash, it does so in an exclusive manner, and a user cannot buy or sell in multiple currencies at the same time. To support this, the OpenBazaar wallet required a significant refactor that is still ongoing.The end result will be an iOS and Android mobile app that will run a full OpenBazaar node that can transact in Bitcoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Zcash as a start. This will truly empower people all of the world to start earning and using cryptocurrencies in a global decentralised marketplace with zero fees.Looking for a lightly used Aventador on @openbazaar with this Android phone... pic.twitter.com/c7pk5WSGBZ&mdash; Brian Hoffman (@brianchoffman) March 17, 2018WebRunning OpenBazaar in a browser is more difficult. The network is built on top of IPFS. Running an OpenBazaar node is essentially running a custom IPFS node. There is an effort underway to have an IPFS node run in browser called IPFS-JS, and we believe this will allow us to build a web-based OpenBazaar version. Building the web-based version is a significant task, and we believe it will take us into early 2019.We expect the payoff to be worth the wait. The initial web-based client will allow buyers to make purchases without needing to download anything. Users can share links to stores or listings that will be viewable from the web. These improvements won’t compromise the completely distributed architecture of the network; all the necessary code is run client-side in the browser.Developer supportSoftware development can be messy, especially in an innovative space where things change quickly. We made our own 1.0 version of OpenBazaar obsolete with 2.0 in only a year and a half. In order to get 2.0 out the door we didn’t focus much effort on supporting external developers, and as a result the project isn’t nearly as approachable to new contributors as we’d like. To fix this we’re now taking a few steps to make the project more friendly to external contributors:  Improving documentation for existing repositories  Organizing / supporting software other than the main client / server repositories  Formalizing the protocol separately from the reference implementation  Offering bounties for bugs or new features / apps on top of OpenBazaarTokenContent discovery in a completely decentralized network can be difficult. Custom curation is a new feature we’ll be adding (see “Improved Content Discovery” below), but it’s not immediately clear why a user would take the time to offer curation services. It’s also unclear how a vendor advertises their listings in a network that nobody controls.In order to create incentives for curators, and to give vendors the ability to advertise, we’re introducing the OpenBazaar Token.The token whitepaper draft is complete and will be published in the near future.You can read more about the token and sign up to receive updates as well.New featuresNew clients and the new token infrastructure are huge improvements for the ecosystem and will take a substantial part of development effort, but that’s not all we’re going to be doing this year. There are plenty of new features we want to add into the software as well.Cryptocurrency listingsOpenBazaar has always had three listing types available: physical goods, digital goods, and services. We’re now adding a fourth: cryptocurrency. Users will now be able to buy and sell cryptocurrencies directly with each other on the platform. No fees, no need to register with any service, and no threat of an exchange getting hacked.You can walk through a prototype of this feature here. We’re building this right now and it should be included in the next OpenBazaar release.RequestsCryptocurrencies aren’t the only new listing type we’ll be introducing. We’ll also be adding requests, allowing buyers to make offers to purchase something if someone provides it to them.The marketplace is currently one-sided with only vendors telling buyers what they have available. But with the requests feature it now becomes two-sided. Buyers tell vendors what they want, and then vendors can compete with each other to fulfil the open orders.This feature will change OpenBazaar from a platform where content is solely dictated by vendors to one where vendors and buyers both have the ability to change what is being offered. This listing type won’t be limited to physical goods either; users will be able to request digital goods, services, and cryptocurrencies as well.Automated digital downloadsDigital goods are a great use case for cryptocurrency, but the current method of fulfilling orders placed for digital goods requires manual effort from the vendor. This new feature will automate the process so that it’s as simple as “send money, get file.”Improved Content DiscoveryHaving search providers directly in the application has been a huge improvement for product discovery over the old 1.0 version, but users still don’t have a good way to browse listings, or to curate groups of listings themselves.We’ll be adding a feature that allows buyers to browse groups of listings that have been curated by other users on the network. These curated lists can be anything – goods sold only in a specific location, a niche style, goods based on popularity, the curator will be able to choose content lists based on any criteria they choose.Browsing experience in OpenBazaar. Designs may change.Better Reputation &amp; IdentityCurrently buyers in OpenBazaar can leave reviews on transactions and those reviews are aggregated to show the vendor’s reputation. This is the only reputation metric we have in place, and we want to expand this moving forward. Decentralized reputation and identity is an incredibly difficult problem to solve, and there are no clear solutions that exist, but we know of a few ways to improve.One improvement is the addition of handles. This was a feature in the 1.0 version that hasn’t made it into 2.0 yet, the ability to tie your OpenBazaar ID (which is currently a random string of characters) into a human-readable name. For example, the store run by the development team has the following ID:  ob://QmcUDmZK8PsPYWw5FRHKNZFjszm2K6e68BQSTpnJYUsML7/storeThis isn’t possible to memorize, but with the handles feature users could just type in a name such as “@OpenBazaar” to visit the store. It can also use DNS to resolve names.Handles may also allow users to tie into existing identity systems, such as Blockstack. If the user has tied other accounts into the identity system, then this acts as a way to bootstrap reputation and increase trust among users.Development of better reputation / identity hasn’t begun yet, so we welcome ideas and assistance in building this feature.OpenBazaar FoundationOpenBazaar has always been – and will always be – open source and free to use. The company OB1 has been the primary development team for most of OpenBazaar’s history, and have chosen not to directly monetize the protocol, but will be offering services to users on the network instead.The ensure the protocol will be maintained in the long-run, and to allow community members to play a larger role in guiding the development and maintenance of the protocol, network, and reference implementations, we’re considering the creation of an OpenBazaar Foundation.The specific mission of the organization is being decided now, but the overall goal would be to ensure that there always exists a place online where people can engage in free, private, permissionless trade.This new nonprofit would lead a transition away from OB1 being the primary maintainers of the protocol towards a community model of management.The foundation creation process has only just begun, so if you have input or wish to help in the process, please let us know.What do you think?Love our roadmap?

The funds will help capitalize on the explosive growth that OpenBazaar has seen as blockchain and cryptocurrencies have become mainstream. OpenBazaar is the only e-commerce marketplace that offers secure, commission-free trade for both buyers and sellers.Since the launch of the updated 2.0 platform near the end of 2017, over 40,000 nodes globally have joined the OpenBazaar network. In early 2018 OpenBazaar enhanced its value to buyers and sellers by enabling purchases with Bitcoin Cash and Zcash.The round represents a strong validation of OB1’s stewardship of the OpenBazaar network and is led by OMERS Ventures, the venture capital arm of the OMERS pension fund. Bitmain is also contributing to this round and joins existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures, BlueYard Capital, Digital Currency Group, and angel investor William Mougayar.“OB1 allows individuals, living anywhere, to buy and sell as part of a truly global marketplace” said Jim Orlando, Managing Partner, OMERS Ventures. “We are excited about the potential represented by OpenBazaar’s decentralized peer-to-peer protocol, and are thrilled about the various implementation paths that Brian and the rest of his team are pursuing.”OB1 will continue to lead development of OpenBazaar to give users more flexibility and control over how they buy and sell goods and services online. Their plans for this year include releasing web and mobile versions of the application as well as giving users new ways to trade with each other, such as making requests and buying and selling cryptocurrencies. OB1 is also expanding the services it offers to users on OpenBazaar, such as the Verified Moderators program, released this week.OB1 CEO Brian Hoffman said, “We are pleased to be partnering with both OMERS Ventures and Bitmain, adding them to a powerhouse international team of investors that are helping our team continue to build the future of free trade on the Internet worldwide. Our goal is to see the OpenBazaar protocol and software empower business owners and consumers alike to shift away from the corporate-controlled legacy systems and engage in ecommerce in a free, fair and independent way.”Users and fans can follow the progress of this open source project and join their community on Slack, Twitter, and Reddit and download the desktop application at OpenBazaar.org",

This is in response to times when buyers don’t know that completing their orders is what releases the funds to a seller.  Listing types for cryptocurrencies –  Automatic downloads for digital sales –Server updates:The OB1 team is working on ways to make it easier easier for development community members to invest their effort into the OpenBazaar codebase more effectively.Questions &amp; Discussion:One attendee offered that he’s been working on a JavaScript library to aide his own development work and OB1 encouraged anyone that is interested in contributing in this way to jump right in without waiting for the core development team to start the activity.How has OB1 integrated Tor &amp; what was that experience like?OB1 briefly discussed how OpenBazaar relies on users having their own Tor browser set up. This requires some configuration work on the user’s part on Windows and Mac and further questions were parlayed to OB1’s Lead Backend Developer, Chris, for deeper answers when he returns.How can users best connect other chains to OB without forking OpenBazaar?Another attendee has been looking at permissioned hyperledger channels for patient/provider profiles and an Ethereum ERC20 token as a payment method and they wondered about the interoperability of OpenBazaar with other chains.OpenBazaar is 2 pieces, server &amp; client. The nature of OpenBazaar is that it is not controlled by any one party, which makes restricting what nodes or listings anyone using it interacts with impossible. You would need to create a custom client and/or server that used a 3rd party service that provided a list of allowed content the custom app would be able to see. It’s important to note though that the rest of the OB network would still see that content, and be able to interact with it.OpenBazaar content is stored using IPFS, they have some new technology they are releasing in the near future that may help with restricting content to certain viewers.Finally, another attendee is working to gather support for a non-profit type coalition to raise awareness of the economic situation in Venezeuela &amp; get solutions to the people there in the form of Bitcoin. You can read more about his agenda here. At this time the scheduled call resolved but those who were interested continued for almost 45 more minutes to discuss this idea.Up next: Due to the increasing demand for participation in this call we are working to choose a more scalable tool to use so that more community members can join. These are the top 5 that we have been recommended. Do you have thoughts on any of these? Please share them in our Slack!  YouTube Live  Zoom  GoToWebinar  Crowdcast.io  Big Blue Button",

The first relates to the vision of what we want OpenBazaar to become and the second was just practical.Check out this video OB1 Co-Founder, Sam Patterson, made to explain:    These were the first cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin to be natively integrated which means that sellers can now receive their payments in these coins. Buyers can also pay with any of dozens of coins as supported by Shapeshift and both of these features give users even more opportunities for customization and control in this decentralized marketplace.Bitcoin Cash and Zcash were chosen to integrate first due to their general technical compatibility with OpenBazaar – being similar to Bitcoin – and the availability of shared development support.

                "content": "Today we are proud to announce Bitcoin Cash and Zcash (Beta) integration in OpenBazaar! With this update users will have the option to create new nodes for processing Bitcoin Cash and Zcash (Beta) payments, respectively.OpenBazaar already allows buyers to fund their wallets with a variety of cryptocurrencies through Shapeshift, but before this release all transactions were still resolved with Bitcoin. With the rise in Bitcoin network fees in 2017, it became clear that OpenBazaar users needed support for cryptocurrencies with fees that are more suited for small to medium sized transactions ASAP.This release is the first step towards allowing more options for cryptocurrencies in OpenBazaar. It includes native support for nodes using one cryptocurrency at a time, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, or ZCash.More currencies and multiple currency support per node are on our roadmap for future releases.OpenBazaar 2.1  Release NotesThis is a major milestone release, which incorporates support for Bitcoin Cash and ZCash into the OpenBazaar platform.New Features  Users can now choose BTC, BCH, or ZEC when installing OpenBazaar, and can switch between currencies by creating and using a new server.  Users can now block nodes they no longer want to see content from.A warning about potential scams that links to an external page about scam prevention was added to the purchase flow.Improvements  The way the client shuts down the server when closing was improved.  The link to the obsolete docs page was replaced by a link to the main OB website in the right click menu.  The Rawflood search provider is no longer being supported by its creator, it has been removed as a default.  When in search, the search provider call automatically includes the user’s current crypto currency.  Ratings are now shown if they are zero, so it’s more clear if a listing or user has zero ratings.  Electron was updated to v1.7.11.  If a default search provider’s logo doesn’t load, the local version is used instead.  The code for getting the version from package.json was simplified.  Line breaks are now preserved in the order details chat and the order memo.  Search now supports checkboxes in filters.  Moderators now show the crypto currency (currently just one per node) they support, and users cannot add one if they don’t support the same currency the user’s node is set to.Bug Fixes  Fixed typos.  Fixed an issue with categories.  The name of the store in the note on a transaction is no longer missing from the order details.  The order details avatar no longer gets stuck in a loading state.  Formatting was fixed on the reviews page.  A bug in moderating orders was corrected.  The payment details address in a moderated case is now correct.  The missing shipping method was added to the order details screen.  If an order is disputed, sellers can no longer refund it.  The QR code was fixed for all supported cryptocurrencies.  A bug in the View Listing link was fixed.  Order IDs are no longer incorrectly treated as links in chat.InternationalizationWe are actively translating the text in the OpenBazaar reference client.

                "content": "Since going live in November OpenBazaar has seen almost 25,000 nodes come online and they continue to trend upward each day! We have had an intense &amp; exciting few weeks working on the network and responding to user feedback and we want to share a few things we will be rolling out in January.Cryptocurrency integrationsShortly after launch Bitcoin fees significantly increased, making buying and selling everyday items and services difficult on OpenBazaar. To present more options to users so that they can avoid Bitcoin fees, we are working quickly to integrate the coins Bitcoin Cash, Zcash and Litecoin.Testing for BCH and Zcash has begun and we’re at the beginning stages of exploring how Litecoin integration would work.Transactions bug fixThere have been reports of order messages not being received so in the new builds we’ve increased the amount of log data to help the reporting users track down the problem.Releases 2.0.20 and 2.0.21 fix bugs relating to the exchange rate API implementation that was causing problems in the purchase flow.Scam mitigationOpenBazaar is an ecommerce platform that imposes no marketplace fees, no data collection, and no censorship; there is no middleman involved at all who can tell users what they can and can’t do on the network. This means exciting new freedom but  but we are also aware that not everyone will always operate in the best interest of their fellow humans. We’ve seen an increase in scammers and we are working hard to add tools to make it easier to identify who is likely to be a trustworthy user on the network, specifically moderators, and we have are doing two things to help minimize the impact of actions like these.The first is user education, trying to help users fully understand the qualities of a fully decentralized ecommerce network and the risks of using unknown moderators along with other unsafe behaviors.The second is working on a verified moderators program that will help users select trusted moderators to avoid scams. These changes should be available in January.Time delays in transactions &amp; refunds postingWe’ve been asked by some users why their transactions and refunds are being delayed. This is likely due to the Bitcoin network fees again and transaction backlog on the Bitcoin network. Transactions and refunds can take up to several days to post in some cases right now and most users do notice them posting after some time has passed. Make sure the fee being paid is less than the transactions amount itself, otherwise the transaction cannot be completed.Thank YouWe want to to thank you for being a part of this community and for your patience with these challenges that have arisen in the 6 weeks since launch. The continued use and exploration of OpenBazaar even despite high fees and transaction difficulties show that so many of you are very, very dedicated to making a free, decentralized marketplace work for you. The great feedback that you have given us is helping us to make informed choices about what is most important to OpenBazaar users and we are working hard to define and develop this whole new paradigm of empowered ecommerce with you.**Have thoughts to share or just want to learn more?**Please join us in our discussion communities here!OpenBazaar SlackOpenBazaar DiscordOpenBazaar TelegramOpenBazaar Reddit",

                "title": "OpenBazaar Tokens and Smart Contracts", 
                "content": "This article is a high level overview of the OpenBazaar token (OBT). The token will be used as inputs for OBT smart contracts, executed on Ethereum, to embed data pointers for content hosted on the OpenBazaar network.Using this framework, OBT will be used by curators to monetise ‘channels’ (curated lists of content) by accepting tokens for premium ad-spaces. Moreover, OBT can be used to create decentralised channels that use market auction forces to arrange content, for which the OpenBazaar channel will be the first of its kind.The token adds value to the OpenBazaar protocol without acting as a gatekeeper to the protocol, or threatening its stability. Ethereum contracts using the token are also independent of the token itself, enabling the system to be flexible to additional features and bug fixes.The smart contracts that are powered by OBT add a layer of utility and value to the network.The creation of a decentralised ad-spaces allows enhanced discovery of goods and services independent of the success or failure of OB1 and other companies built on top of OpenBazaar.1. Discovery and SearchDecentralised networks tend to have a ‘discovery’ problem, whereby data in the network is either: a) distributed so well it is difficult for a user to crawl and parse, or b) redundantly shared in its entirety between peers, causing storage and maintenance costs to soar as the network scales.OpenBazaar is no different. The sheer number of listings, images, and soon social content, published by nodes on the network already exceeds the capability of a typical user to find and process. As a result, third party services for search and discovery are required for the marketplace to thrive. In addition, user-driven curation is a powerful model to drive attention and sales to sellers. Incentivising this is the purpose of the OpenBazaar token.1. OpenBazaar TokensOpenBazaar tokens (OBT) will be created on the Ethereum network. The token itself will have a fixed total supply. OBT can be transferred between accounts, or used as inputs for the execution of OBT smart contracts. OBT smart contracts require OBT to change the state of the contract to embed data into the Ethereum blockchain in the form of OpenBazaar-IPFS content addresses. These content addresses are essentially pointers to data hosted by peers on the OpenBazaar network.Each OpenBazaar node monitors OBT smart contracts for state changes corresponding to new content addresses, which are used to retrieve data from the OpenBazaar network and displayed for the user in the OpenBazaar client.Using this framework, the following primary utilities of the token, described below, can be supported.Figure 1. Channels. With channels, any user or group can curate listings, stores, social posts, and even other channels.1.2 ChannelsA ‘channel’ is a data structure (JSON) that arranges OpenBazaar content (i.e. listings, images, stores, social content etc) into user-defined collections. This user-curated list of content, i.e. the channel data, is parsed and rendered in the client to enhance search and discovery of goods and services. Any individual or group can create a channel for any subject or theme, which users on the network can subscribe to (Figure 1). By keeping a channel updated with freshly curated content, the channel author can enhance the discovery of valuable content, goods, and services on the network that can simultaneously drive attention and sales.To monetise a channel, an OpenBazaar smart contract can be deployed on the Ethereum network to auction off, in OBT, premium content positions within a channel. Advertisers can target popular channels to purchase ad space, paying the channel author in OBT.Figure 2. Alice creates a listing. The listing has a content address (Address D) that allows anyone on the OpenBazaar P2P network to find the listing and download it. The content address maps to a JSON file, which is the Ricardian contract containing the good or service for sale.1.3  Decentralising a Channel with OBTWhile advertising spaces in a channel can monetise curation by an individual channel author, this model can be extended to create a decentralised channel. To explain how, we will examine the OpenBazaar channel as an example.By default, the desktop and OB1 mobile apps will be subscribed to the OpenBazaar channel. As the default channel, it will have a strong position as the regular entry point for discovering new and interesting things for sale in OpenBazaar.Figure 3. Alice embeds the listing’s content address (Address D) into the Ethereum blockchain. Alice purchases a state change in an OpenBazaar smart contract using OBT tokens. The transaction results in ‘Address D’ being embedded into the Ethereum blockchain.Similar to ENS registration, an Ethereum contract will be used to execute a Vickrey auction every 12–24 hours for content spaces in the OpenBazaar channel. With a Vickrey auction, bids are anonymous with the winning bidder paying the second highest bid-value in OBT. As there are several content spaces, the top n bids will fill these spaces in order, locking up the n-1 OBT bid value.For a user to bid for a space on the OpenBazaar channel, they first create the listing they wish to advertise and publish it to the OpenBazaar network to obtain a content address (Figure 2). Next, the user participates in Vickrey auction to embed their listing address into the state of the contract.This &lt;em”&gt;address is stored in the Ethereum blockchain, while the content itself is distributed in the OpenBazaar network. The OpenBazaar server-node monitors the Ethereum blockchain for the latest channel content, stored in the OBT contract, and fetches the data corresponding to the addresses from the OpenBazaar network.&lt;/em”&gt;When the user navigates to the OpenBazaar channel, they will view the ‘premium’ content from the Vickrey auction’s winning bids.In the case of the OpenBazaar channel, OBT from the winning bids will be sent to the OpenBazaar Foundation, a nonprofit entity tasked with maintaining and expanding the OpenBazaar protocol. These tokens will be used to fund operations and/or recycled back into the ecosystem.For other decentralised channels, the OBT can be burned or saved. In the case of the latter, a governance mechanism is required to manage saved OBT between the smart contract owners. More details on this will be provided at a later date.The Ethereum contract to support the Vickrey auction for the OpenBazaar channel can be deployed by other channel developers or communities. This would allow other decentralised channels to be maintained and funded by OBT.Aside from increasing demand and adding value to OBT investors, it will also support a more robust mechanism for discovery on the network. However, as these channels would not necessarily be included by default in the reference desktop client or OB1 mobile app, users will need to actively find and subscribe to these channels.Figure 4. Alice’s content is discovered by other nodes monitoring OBT contracts in Ethereum. OpenBazaar nodes monitor state changes in the OBT contract, in the Ethereum blockchain, to discover new content. The content itself is distributed across the OpenBazaar network.1.4 Search: OpenBazaar Ad NetworkA more experimental proposal is to support a decentralized advertising network using OBT. OBT can be spent to associate certain words to an OB-IPFS address for a listing. When OpenBazaar users search for goods or services using these keywords, listings with the highest OBT spend appear at the top of the search results as ‘premium’ listings. While not a complete solution to the challenges of decentralised search, OBT enables Vendors to advertise their content in response to specific search terms.2.  Platform FlexibilityThe role of the token in the protocol is flexible and capable of evolving as improvements are made. The reason is that the OBT token is used as a money substitute for executing specific Ethereum smart contracts, which the OpenBazaar node monitors on the Ethereum blockchain.This means that if there is a critical security flaw uncovered in the Vickrey auction contract, for example, the contract can be retired or replaced without threatening the viability of all OBT tokens. All that is required is an update to the OpenBazaar server to monitor a patched contract after block X, and OBT will be spent on this new contract.This same mechanism can be used to iterate over existing contracts with new features. As the OpenBazaar protocol matures, the server can also monitor new contracts funded by OBT, which client developers can support.3.  ChallengesWe have identified the following challenges with this token model below.3.1  AbuseEconomically irrational actors (trolls, hackers, spammers) or ‘whales’ (individuals or organisations with a lot of Eth) could monopolise the OpenBazaar channel or ad-word auctions to flood the channel with spam, illegal, or abusive content.This challenge is mitigated indirectly as there is a financial cost to this behaviour, and a sustained attack would be expensive. For a more direct approach, this can be achieved a number of ways. The channel author(s) who deploys a smart contract to receive ad-sponsorship can have ‘veto power’ over any of the content spaces, or flag content as NSFW. Client developers could also actively filter content from the OpenBazaar channel, or ad-word listings, on an opt-in basis.Moreover, it is likely that third parties will serve the OpenBazaar channel and ad-word data to users, as the requirements to run an Ethereum node may be too much for individual users. These third parties can filter the data according to their own requirements. If users are unhappy with the degree of filtering, they can switch between service providers or run an Ethereum full node for themselves for a completely decentralised experience.3.2  Forked Client Opt-OutForked client implementations of OpenBazaar can effectively ignore the OBT-enabled channels and adwords, or adopt unfair/aggressive filtering of listings. It is up to the users to make an informed choice when selecting an OpenBazaar client.3.3  UpgradingThe process of upgrading from one Ethereum contract to another requires OpenBazaar nodes to upgrade promptly. Non-upgraded nodes will continue to monitor old contracts until upgrade. Similarly, OBT may continue to be spent on old contracts for non-upgraded nodes. While this benefits OBT investors, it is less effective for Vendors advertising their goods and services.4. Why a Token?Earlier this year we published Why an OpenBazaar Token Doesn’t Exist. Our reasons were:  OpenBazaar doesn’t need a token to work  Tokens are a new and unproven model  A token could increase the barriers to entry  Token sales are a regulatory unknownWe briefly examine each point below.Objection #1: OpenBazaar doesn’t need a token to workOpenBazaar still doesn’t need a token to work.The OpenBazaar protocol was designed to be censorship-resistant from the beginning, and doesn’t require a protocol token (other than money) to function. We view this as a feature not a bug, as the core functions of OpenBazaar protocol (i.e. buying and selling) carries-on independent of the token.Therefore, we strongly believe that the purpose of the token is to add value to the OpenBazaar network, and help catalyse adoption. It is for this reason that these smart contracts require OBT instead of Ethereum, as we are able to distribute free tokens to contributors and early adopters (sellers, buyers, moderators) of the protocol, and run an incentive engine through the OpenBazaar Foundation to promote adoption.The framework we propose in this article uses smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to coordinate and incentivise the discovery of content on the OpenBazaar network. The first implementation of this framework, the creation of a decentralised ad-space and adwords, adds value to OpenBazaar by enhancing the search and discovery of goods services that is:  Decentralised and censorship-resistant  Independent of the success or failure of OB1, or other companies built on top of OpenBazaarIt is a complementary feature to third party search and discovery tools that is run by token holders (i.e. the community).Objection #2: Tokens are a new and unproven modelThis is still true, but if there is a way that a token can add utility to the protocol and value for the community, in a decentralised manner, it should be explored. If OBT is successful, it will add value to the OpenBazaar protocol in conjunction with third party search and discovery tools.Also the token itself is somewhat independent from the contracts used to deliver content to channels and adwords. These contracts can be retired or replaced without threatening the total stock of OBT or the protocol. Thus the utility of OBT can evolve with the protocol, and pivot to new or better models in the future.Objection #3: A token could increase the barriers to entryThe functions of an OpenBazaar token should not be a gatekeeper to using the protocol. Here, OBT (and the gas required to make changes in the smart contract) is used to enhance the search and discovery of goods and services in a decentralised manner. However, OBT is not required to search and discover listings via third parties, or any of the core functions of the protocol (i.e. buying, selling, chat, ratings etc).Objection #4: Token sales are a regulatory unknownThe SEC recently published an investor bulletin on token sales. An excellent summary of that report can be found here.A key quote from the investor bulletin was the issue of whether tokens fit the definition of a ‘security’:  Depending on the facts and circumstances of each individual ICO, the virtual coins or tokens that are offered or sold may be securities. If they are securities, the offer and sale of these virtual coins or tokens in an ICO are subject to the federal securities laws.  Under Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act, a security includes “an investment contract.” See 15 U.S.C. §§ 77b-77c. An investment contract is an investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.While we are not lawyers or giving financial advice, in our opinion it is reasonable to conclude OBT is not a security according to this definition. Furthermore, platforms such as Coinlist now exist to facilitate regulatory compliant token sales to accredited investors. However, even if government agencies issued strict regulatory guidelines, it would fail to disrupt the core functions of OpenBazaar, which the token is not required for.The token sale would be an opportunity to distribute tokens to users of OpenBazaar who believe in decentralisation and free trade and are not solely focused on speculation. It is essential that a portion of OBT is distributed to existing users, and incentivise new and existing ecommerce Vendors to extend their footprint into OpenBazaar. The utility of OBT primarily serves Vendors who wish to advertise their goods and services on the network, in a decentralised manner. While speculators will undoubtedly be interested in profiting off the token, the fundamental utility of token is unambiguous.The token would not increase the barriers to entry into the OpenBazaar network. As mentioned earlier, the ability to use the protocol is unaffected by the existence of the token. Vendors can also advertise their goods and services via centralised channels and third party search engines.Given that the token model described here doesn’t appear to be a security, and has concrete utility to help Vendors sell their goods and services, we feel that OBT will be viewed favourably within the emerging regulatory guidelines. If burdensome regulations are imposed on tokens in a local jurisdiction, the OpenBazaar protocol itself is unaffected by the difficulties in obtaining tokens by those users. Moreover, token holders that are not affected by these regulations are minimally impacted.6.

            "blog-openbazaar-and-bitcoin-fees": { 
                "title": "OpenBazaar and Bitcoin Fees", 
                "content": "OpenBazaar currently uses Bitcoin for all payments, which allows us to enjoy the primary benefit of the leading cryptocurrency: secure payments without needing to trust a third party. No payment processors or banks needed, you control your own trade and your own money.Bitcoin has many advantages over other payment methods, but there are disadvantages as well. One disadvantage is obvious to anyone using OpenBazaar at the moment: Bitcoin fees are extremely high.OpenBazaar started in mid-2014, when fees averaged less than $0.10, and fees still averaged only around $0.20 when we began work on OpenBazaar 2.0 in summer 2016. In the past year we’ve seen rapid increases in fees, and the past week has seen fees at levels that severely inhibit lower value ecommerce transactions (fees are now well over $5).The reasons for the increase in fees is complicated and not the purpose of this article. It’s also important to note that these fees are not guaranteed to stay this high forever – it’s possible that fees will drop to more ecommerce-friendly levels soon – but we aren’t just crossing our fingers waiting for this to happen.  The question is, what has OpenBazaar done about high Bitcoin fees, and what more can be done?What we’ve doneThe new version of OpenBazaar, released Nov 1st, has a built-in Bitcoin wallet. We choose to build a wallet into the software because it gave users a better experience and because it allowed us to do more complicated Bitcoin transactions, such as multisig escrow and timelock.The OpenBazaar development team decided to implement Segwit (a change to Bitcoin that can create cheaper transactions) in order to alleviate fee pressure and so that OpenBazaar wallets were compatible with other wallets as Segwit adoption increased. Segwit was implemented at launch, and is used by default when possible in transactions.As fees increased we also saw the need to limit user’s actions to prevent transactions from being stuck in the escrow multisig. We use 2-of-3 multisig for moderated payments and a 1-of-2 multisig for offline ordering. Multisig transactions are powerful tools, but they require two Bitcoin fees instead of one. Not normally a problem with $0.10 fees, but when you are purchasing a $5 item and there’s a $5 fee, your payment will never be released to the vendor. Also, vendors are naturally upset to pay a $5 fee when receiving payment for a $10 item, which is effectively a 50% fee. For a detailed look at how Bitcoin fees work in OpenBazaar, you can read point #5 in our vendor guide.We have addressed this by preventing users from purchasing items which aren’t significantly higher than the current fee price. This prevents stuck transactions and angry vendors, but it also prevents people from using OpenBazaar for buying or selling inexpensive items. We want OpenBazaar to be a free marketplace for anyone to buy and sell anything, regardless of the overall price of the good or service, so this solution wasn’t something we were happy to implement.What we will doThough we’ve adopted Segwit in an effort to help our users reduce Bitcoin fees, second layer solutions like the Lightning Network aren’t available for end users yet so that will remain a bit of a waiting game.Next, however, we are working to integrate other cryptocurrencies into OpenBazaar. Work on this has already begun and several community members from other coins have been working on integration. Initially we’ll likely offer just two or three other cryptocurrencies in addition to Bitcoin, but the long term goal is for OpenBazaar to be coin agnostic and allow payments in any cryptocurrency.Because OpenBazaar is a fully decentralized p2p network, supporting various cryptocurrencies isn’t a simple change. This is currently the development team’s top priority, but users will need to wait more than Two Weeks™ to be able to use the new coins.What you can doThere are a few things you can do that will reduce the impact of high fees.                    Everyone: Be mindful of prices and fees If you’re a vendor, consider listing higher value items while fees are high and being clear with buyers about why you are or aren’t willing to sell certain items and / or have certain prices. Buyers should pay attention to the fees when purchasing as well.                    Vendors: Keep your stores online When buyers place an order while the vendor is offline, the vendor pays an extra Bitcoin fee when they fulfill the order. Vendors who want to avoid paying that extra fee should keep their store running as often as possible.                    Developers: Help get your favorite coin added to OpenBazaar! If you’re a developer, particularly if you’re knowledgeable with cryptocurrencies, you can help us integrate these new coins. If you’re not a developer, but you want another cryptocurrency integrated into OpenBazaar, try to get some community support to urge the coin’s developer community to contribute.

However, we strongly recommend closing your v1 OB node and transitioning to OB v2, which is under extremely active development, has a growing community, and is a much better piece of software.Ready to get started?Download OpenBazaar now!",

                "content": "Washington, D.C. – November 1, 2017 – OpenBazaar 2.0 beta was released in September and has seen rapid growth through October resulting in over 10,000 nodes coming onto the new network in less than 50 days. Now, after nearly 2 months of testing and a successful Crypto Is Currency Day, an event with industry-wide support, the next version of revolutionary open-source software is launching.Users from all over the world are demonstrating that their values align with OpenBazaar and they are seeking a marketplace that is secure, private and free to use. Since version 1.0 launched in 2015, the software has been downloaded over 250,000 times and this new release builds on the feedback from thousands of community members. Version 2.0 enables self-hosted stores to be more visible, provide buyers and sellers with even greater control over personal privacy, and enables developers within the OpenBazaar ecosystem with enhanced capabilities to build new applications for the marketplace.With a beautiful new design that represents 18 months of investment, over a dozen major improvements have been made to the marketplace. Some of the most advanced and demanded include networking changes that allow stores to be accessible around the clock, privacy enhancements, a built-in SegWit-ready Bitcoin wallet, and infrastructure improvements that make it easier for developers to build their own tools on the platform. Buyers and sellers will enjoy new features that improve their ecommerce experience including inventory management, expanded shipping options, product variants, multiple search providers, and more. All users now have more control of their browsing experience with the new block &amp; report features.OB1 CEO Brian Hoffman, stated, “The first version of OpenBazaar proved that decentralized trade was possible, and we’ve learned so much in the past year and a half since OpenBazaar was first launched. OpenBazaar 2.0 incorporates the tens of thousands of pieces of feedback we’ve received from our community. This software represents the next major step in our efforts to liberate people from the expensive, privacy-invading intermediaries that dominate ecommerce today.”OpenBazaar has pushed the limits of what peer-to-peer technology can do with a familiar and practical use case – online commerce – that anyone can participate in at no cost. Traditionally, peer-to-peer software has been difficult to install and run, preventing all but the most experienced users from participating, but OpenBazaar users can join the network in minutes without any technical expertise needed.“The internet needs an open and free marketplace that allows buying and selling, using the money of the future: cryptocurrency,” says early OpenBazaar investor and blockchain advocate William Mougayar. “OpenBazaar is giving us a compelling answer to the question, ‘Where do I spend my Bitcoin?’ and this new release 2.0 gets us closer than ever to where peer-to-peer e-commerce is headed.”Venture-backed company OB1 is leading the core development of OpenBazaar. OB1 has raised funds from Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, BlueYard, Digital Currency Group and angel investor William Mougayar in order to build and launch a completely decentralized marketplace that allows anyone in the world to buy and sell anything to anyone else, anywhere, for free.Join the great community behind this open source project.

                "title": "OpenBazaar Buyer Guide - What To Expect in This Decentralized Marketplace", 
                "content": "You’re looking to buy on OpenBazaar; welcome! This guide will help you know what to expect when you use the world’s most private, secure, and liberating online marketplace.While OpenBazaar has some similarities to traditional ecommerce websites like eBay, Amazon or Etsy, this marketplace is a fundamentally different way to buy goods and services online.First, it’s not a website at all, but software that you must download. This is necessary at this time because of how it allows users to connect to each other across the decentralized marketplace.What does decentralized mean?A decentralized marketplace gives users many advantages over other platforms: no marketplace fees, no data collection, and no censorship.It also means you have all of your user information on your own computer. You aren’t trusting anyone else to control your money or trade. This is also referred to as a peer-to-peer (or P2P) network because users connect directly to each other and there are no big, centralized servers run by a single company, as with eBay, Amazon or Etsy.Decentralization has many advantages, but there are trade-offs as well, and this guide is meant to equip buyers with realistic expectations about how OpenBazaar works and what they should expect. If you are used to making purchases through other e-commerce platforms and expect the same experience, we want to make sure you are not confused about what is going on, here!Some parts of this guide will discuss the technical details to help explain why things work the way they do. If learning the details doesn’t interest you, feel free to skip those sections, which are labelled “More information.” Throughout this article I’ll be referring to your “user information,” which means the OpenBazaar program running on your computer and the data it contains for you.Here are 5 things you need to know about when buying on OpenBazaar.1) You are entirely responsible for all of your account and transaction dataYour user information exists nowhere but on your own computer. If your hard drive fails, or your computer is inaccessible for any reason, then you’ve lost the coins in your wallet or any active transactions.That is, unless you’ve backed up your data! You need to backup this data as soon as you create your profile. This data needs to be backed up somewhere other than the drive your user information is located on, such as an external hard drive, otherwise the backup does you no good. Please note that this backup should be in a place that isn’t accessible to anyone else; with this backup someone else could take control of your user account.There are two steps to backing up your user information. First, in the OpenBazaar client go into Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced, then click “Show Seed.” Write down those words, in order, on a piece of paper, and keep it somewhere safe. This will allow you to recreate your OpenBazaar node ID and your wallet in case something goes wrong.However, that seed will not recreate your listings or any open orders you had, so if you choose to create a store down the line, please refer to OpenBazaar Vendor Guide: What to Expect when Selling on The World’s Largest Decentralized Marketplace2) Payment types are different – there are 3 typesThere are three types of payments in OpenBazaar, and it’s important to understand how fees impact these payments:  Direct payments  Moderated payments  Offline paymentsDirect PaymentsDirect payments are a buyer sending coins to the vendor and both parties are online. There is only one fee paid and the buyer pays it on top of the price of the item.Moderated PaymentsModerated payments occur when the buyer selects a moderator and payment goes into escrow. There are two fees paid, one is paid by the buyer when they fund the escrow and the other is taken out of the total amount in escrow when funds are released. Assuming there isn’t a dispute and funds are released to the vendor, then effectively the vendor has paid the second fee, since they receive the total in the escrow minus the cost of the fee.Here’s an example: let’s say you want to buy a painting for $100. You choose a moderated payment and pay $100 plus a $1.50 fee (network fees vary) that goes to the coin miners. The $100 are now securely in the escrow. The vendor ships your painting and when you receive it and are happy with it, you release the funds. Since they shipped the painting coin fees have increased slightly, so when funds were released to the vendor a $1.75 fee was taken out of the total $100 and they will receive $98.25 in their wallet.Two out of three parties are always needed to release funds from a moderated order, so if one of the parties goes unresponsive and doesn’t release funds then the other party will be forced to open a dispute with the moderator. A moderator will charge a fee (which comes out of the total escrowed funds) to close a dispute, so it’s in both parties interest to be responsive and not abandon orders.Offline PaymentsThere is a third type of payment: Offline payments. These happen when the vendor is offline. If the buyer makes a moderated payment to an offline vendor then it acts the same as a regular moderated payment. If the buyer makes a direct payment to an offline vendor, then the funds are put into a temporary escrow account that either buyer or vendor can pull from. If the vendor comes back online they can either accept or reject the offline order. If they accept and fulfil the order, then they receive the payment and receive the funds minus a coin fee. If the vendor never comes back online (or they reject the offline order when they come back online), then the buyer pulls the funds back, and they receive the funds minus a coin fee. Doing an offline payment means one party will be paying an extra coin fee, so it’s better for the vendor to be online for orders if possible.3) Transaction flow is differentThough buyers can choose to fund their internal OpenBazaar wallet with a variety of coins as supported by Shapeshift, all orders on OpenBazaar are still settled in one of 3 cryptocurrencies that each user chooses upon setup: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Zcash.Using this wallet is straightforward, but there are a few areas that could confuse you.First, when you click “Buy Now” to initiate your checkout of an item the vendor will get an alert that you have begun checkout. No funds are moved at this stage, you must then click “Pay” to continue funding &amp; placing an order. If you do not and change your mind you can still leave at this time but the vendor will have an alert that you started and may reach out to see if they can help or answer any questions.If you do continue and pay for the order it may take a bit for the vendor to see it on the respective coin network. They will often need to wait for one confirmation on the coin payment before it displays as funded. If you choose to pay a low coin fee and / or there is congestion on the respective coin network, the process of confirmation could take up to several hours.If you are uncertain about anything with your order remember that you can message the vendor within the app and chat with them. They’re real people too and they are generally happy to work with you!4) Communication between users isn’t always happening in real timeOn that note, messages work a little differently in a p2p application. First, remember that OpenBazaar users are individuals located all around the world and a vendor you would like to buy from may be in a very different time zone.Second, because this is a P2P network where users are trying to communicate directly with each other’s computers, many users’ computers and networks aren’t configured to allow this properly. As a result, messages can be delayed, sometimes significantly.What this looks like in OpenBazaar is an order being placed by a buyer, but a vendor maybe not seeing the order for another hour or so. Or the same delay happening with chat messages. This confuses both parties who expect the messages to arrive immediately. It’s important to note that the messages aren’t lost; they are being hosted on the network (in something called a distributed hash table or DHT) but the receiving node won’t know about them for a little while.  More information  This is happening because many users’ networks are set up to only make outgoing connections, so they are able to connect out to someone but they aren’t able to accept incoming connections. This means that other computers can’t send your computer a message directly. OpenBazaar still works without accepting incoming connections, but the messages won’t be received in real time unless you accept incoming connections.Fixing delays in messagingThere are a few ways to improve messaging. The best way is to do something called port forwarding. Setting up port forwarding allows you to receive messages from the OpenBazaar network in real time. There’s only one port you need to forward:  Port 4001, TCPThis is done by going into your router settings. Google “How to port forward” if you need help. You may also need to add an exception to your firewall to accomplish the same goal. You can check if you’ve successfully opened the port by using this tool and entering port 4001 in the “Port to check” field.If you’re unable to port forward, don’t worry – OpenBazaar will still work for you. But you will need to be aware that orders and chat messages will be delayed.If you are made aware of a messaging issue that continues, make sure that both you and the vendor have up to date versions of OpenBazaar, you’ve both restarted OpenBazaar and you’ve waited at least one hour. Many times the problem is the buyer’s message wasn’t sent properly the first time and a restart should send a new message.4) OpenBazaar imposes no marketplace fees–but each coin network may have transaction feesOne part of cryptocurrencies that can be confusing is the network fees. In order to send a cryptocurrency payment on any network, you need to include a fee. Fees go to coin miners who are securing the network and making sure transactions aren’t fraudulent. These fees vary based on how many other people are trying to send coins at the moment. Fees are often less than $1, but in some cases, like with the Bitcoin network, they can also be over $1 or even $3 to $5 at times.  More information  Your coin network fee also depends on how many inputs are needed to make the transaction. If you only have one input then the fee will be lower, but if you create a transaction with multiple inputs then the fee will be higher, sometimes much higher. By default you won’t use multiple inputs, but if you’ve made a lot of transactions your wallet with have several small change outputs, and of those are combined to make a new input then the fees will be higher.You can partially control how much you want to pay in fees by determining how fast you want the payment to be confirmed by the network. If you want it confirmed as soon as possible (usually less than ten minutes) then you will choose a Priority fee. If you don’t mind waiting a half hour or so, then you can choose a Normal fee. If you don’t mind confirmation taking a few hours, you can choose the Economic fee. You can change your fee settings by going into Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced, choosing your fee and pressing Save.5) OpenBazaar is still a niche communityOpenBazaar is a new and growing network populated by lots of great people who are looking to have more control over how they buy and sell online.

                "content": "Download link for the importer tool.OpenBazaar 2.0 has launched, and brings many improvements over the 1.0 version. These networks aren’t compatible; a vendor selling on the old network will not be able to receive orders on the new network, and vice versa. This means that 1.0 vendors need to open a new store on the new network.Fortunately, opening a new store doesn’t mean you need to recreate all your listings. The OpenBazaar team has created a tool that allows you to export your version 1.0 listings into your new 2.0 store. This tool will move listings from version 1.0 to your 2.0 store, but nothing else. Your profile, settings, and previous reviews will not transition to the 2.0 network.This guide is for vendors who run both version 1.0 and 2.0 stores on their own computers. This guide assumes the importer tool is run on the same computer as the OpenBazaar stores are located. If you used a VPS for either store read the additional information at the end of the article.Step #1: Install OpenBazaar 2.0Note: If you’ve already installed the new OpenBazaar 2.0, you can skip this step.You can’t import your old listings into a new store without having a new store first. Visit our download page to get the latest version of the software. Open the installer and follow the instructions. After clicking “I Agree” to the Terms of Service, you’ll see your new store, looking something like the following image:This means you’ve successfully installed your OpenBazaar 2.0 store and can proceed to the next step. Keep the 2.0 running throughout the rest of the steps.Step #2: Install the Importer ToolDownload the importer tool and install it. Windows users need the .exe installer, OSX users need the .dmg installer, and Ubuntu users need the .deb installer. Advanced users can install from source.You should see something like the following image:If you see the importer tool, you can proceed to the next step.Step #3: Find your Port NumberIf you installed version 1.0 from source then your port number is 18469 by default, which is already entered in the importer tool. You can skip this step.However, most users installed OpenBazaar with the installer download, and their ports were assigned at random. You’ll need to determine your port number in order to enter it in the next step.There are two methods to find your port number. The first involves looking at the debug log. With the version 1.0 application running, you should see the OpenBazaar tent icon running in your system tray. Right click on the tent and you’ll see the option to “View Debug Log.” Clicking this option should open up a text file. You want to search the file for the term “RestAPI starting on” and see the results. You should find a line saying “RestAPI starting on [numbers]” and those numbers are the port number you’re looking for. If you found your port number with the method, you can proceed to the next step.The second method is to open up the version 1.0 application and right click anywhere on the client, then hover over “View” and click “Toggle Developer Tools” as the following image shows:You’ll then see a tool open up on the side of the OpenBazaar client. Click on the “Network” tab on the top, as highlighted in red below, then click on the refresh icon (the circular arrow on the top left of the OpenBazaar client):When you click refresh (or click on anything in the OpenBazaar client while viewing the network tab in developer tools) you’ll see a list of new network calls being made. Click on any one of those network calls, as highlighted in red below:Now click on “Headers” and you’ll see the details of a network call, which will tell you the port number you need. The example picture below shows where to click on the “Headers” tab and then shows where the port number is located:In the above example, the port number is highlighted in blue: 39265. Your port number will be displayed in the same area, directly after http://localhost:[portnumber]/api/…Note this port number and proceed to the next step.Step #4: Open your version 1.0 OpenBazaar store and export listingsOpen the version 1.0 OpenBazaar application. Once it’s running switch to the importer tool. Don’t change the Server IP, but enter the port number you found in the previous step, and don’t check the SSL box. Click on the “Export” button, highlighted in red in this image:If you see red text with a message that says “Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:18469” or similar message, you need to make sure that your version 1.0 OpenBazaar application is running and that you entered the correct port number.If successful, you should see a message with green text that says “The export file (listings.csv) is now available on 127.0.0.1” which means the tool has created a new CSV file with all your listing information. This file is located in the data folder of your 1.0 version (details below), not the 2.0 data folder.You can now shut down your 1.0 version and proceed to the next step.Step #5: Import listings into the 2.0 versionTo make this step simpler, you can move the new listings.csv file from the old data folder to an easy to access folder, such as Desktop or Documents. The new listings.csv file will be located in the following folders, depending on your operating system:Windows: C:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\openbazaarOSX: ~/Library/Application Support/OpenBazaarLinux: ~/.openbazaarCopy the listings.csv file and paste it into a folder you’ll remember.Now switch to the importer tool. Click the “Choose File” button, highlighted in red below:Navigate to the folder you placed the listings.csv file and select the file. Next to the “Choose File” button the text should now read “listings.csv” instead of “No file chosen.”Don’t change the OpenBazaar 2.0 IP Address field or Port Number (this port number is not random), and don’t check the SSL box.With the 2.0 application running, click on the “Import” button, as highlighted in red below:If you see red text with a message that says “Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:4002” or similar message, you need to make sure that your version 2.0 OpenBazaar application is running.If successful, you’ll see some green text giving you progress messages as the importer tool does its work. When finished you should see the message “Listing import completed.” You can now close the importer tool and proceed to the next step.Step #6: Check your new 2.0 store listings and make any necessary changesSwitch to your 2.0 application and navigate to your store page, or if already there, click the refresh icon in the top left of the client. You should now see your new listings in your store. Review them to make sure the data is correct and make any changes necessary.Now that you’ve got your new listings in place, you should finish building your store. Go to Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Store and add an avatar and theme image. Fill out the About sections and let potential buyers know more about your store. The better and more professional looking your store is, the more buyers are likely to buy something from you.Now you’re ready to sell on OpenBazaar 2.0!Details for VPS usersIf you hosted your version 1.0 store on a VPS, there are a few differences from the steps above. In step #4 you need to change the Server IP to the IP address of the VPS. If you used SSL to connect, you’ll also need to check the SSL box. After clicking “Export” your 1.0 server will now have the listings.csv file located on the VPS, not on your local computer. You’ll need to manage step #5 by pulling the listings.csv file out of the VPS OpenBazaar data folder and into your local computer running the importer tool. To do this, you can use SSH, FTP, or other file management tools. This guide might help you.Once you have the listings.csv file you can continue the guide as normal.",

This is also referred to as a peer-to-peer (or P2P) network.Decentralization has many advantages, but there are trade-offs as well, and this guide is meant to equip vendors with realistic expectations about how OpenBazaar works and what they should expect. Being decentralized also means it doesn’t work the same way as other platforms. If you come from another e-commerce platform and expect the same experience, you’ll end up confused and possibly disappointed.Some parts of this guide will discuss the technical details to help explain why things work the way they do. If learning the details doesn’t interest you, feel free to skip those sections, which are labelled “More information.” Throughout this article I’ll be referring to stores, pages, and nodes. These are all the same thing: the OpenBazaar program running on your computer.What does decentralized mean?The primary way OpenBazaar is different from other marketplaces is the fact that’s it’s completely decentralized. What does that mean?Most marketplaces are centralized, meaning there is a company which own the platform and everyone using it connects to a group of computers that the company controls. Because they have total control over the platform, these middlemen can charge their 10% or 20% cut from transactions, they can monitor your data (possibly selling it or having it stolen), and they can censor transactions.OpenBazaar has no middlemen. You download the program onto your computer and it connects you directly to other people running the program. This means there are no middlemen involved in your trade at all. That’s how OpenBazaar avoids fees and censorship: there’s no one in the middle of the trade to charge fees or stop the trade. Buyers and sellers are communicating directly to each other.This is a powerful new way to do commerce, but there are trade-offs being made. Giving someone else control of your money and your store is sometimes more convenient, because you aren’t taking on the responsibility of managing the store yourself.For example, all of your OpenBazaar store data is kept on your own computer. If you were to create an OpenBazaar store – with included cryptocurrency wallet – and you didn’t back up your data, your store could be lost if your hard drive failed. When you take on the responsibility of controlling your own trade entirely, there are extra steps you need to take.OpenBazaar is not a website. There is no one who controls OpenBazaar. You don’t log into an account managed by someone else. When you download and run the software, you are OpenBazaar.OpenBazaar is a community of people running this software in order to buy and sell goods and services with each other. Most people in the community (including the developers) are friendly and will help you if you need help – so you aren’t entirely on your own – but ultimately you’re responsible for taking control of your own trade.Now that we’ve established the biggest difference between OpenBazaar and other platforms, let’s look at how this difference manifests itself for the average vendor.1) You need to backup your store data and walletYour store exists nowhere but on your own computer. If your hard drive fails, or your computer is inaccessible for any reason, then you’ve lost your store and any coins in your wallet.That is, unless you’ve backed up your data! You need to backup this data as soon as you create your store. This data needs to be backed up somewhere other than the drive the store is located on, otherwise the backup does you no good. Please note that this backup should be in a place that isn’t accessible to anyone else; with this backup someone else could take control of your store.There are two steps to backing up your store. First, in the OpenBazaar client go into Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced, then click “Show Seed” (backing up the seed will also be prompted when your OpenBazaar wallet first receives funds.) Write down those words, in order, on a piece of paper, and keep it somewhere safe. This will allow you to recreate your OpenBazaar node ID and your wallet in case something goes wrong.However, that seed will not recreate your listings and any open orders you had, so there’s a second step to backing up your store. You need to make a copy of your data folder, locations are below:Windows: C:\\Users\\[Username]\\OpenBazaar2.0OSX: ~/Library/Application Support/OpenBazaar2.0Linux: ~/.openbazaar2.0Place a copy of this data in a secure place, possibly a external drive or USB drive. If you’re familiar with using encryption, you can encrypt this backup for added safety.It’s a good idea to periodically backup your data folder so that new listings or orders are backed up.2) Communication between users isn’t always happening in real timeWe assume that when we see a message or notification that something new just happened to trigger it, but that’s not always true on OpenBazaar. Because it’s a P2P network users are trying to communicate directly with each other’s computers, but many users’ computers and networks aren’t configured to allow this properly. As a result, messages can be delayed, sometimes significantly.What this looks like in OpenBazaar is an order being placed by a customer, but a vendor not seeing the order for another hour or so. Or the same delay happening with chat messages. This confuses both parties who expect the messages to arrive immediately. It’s important to note that the messages aren’t lost; they are being hosted on the network (in something called a distributed hash table or DHT) but the receiving node won’t know about them for a little while.  More Information  This is happening because many users’ networks are setup to only make outgoing connections, so they are able to connect out to someone but they aren’t able to accept incoming connections. This means that other computers can’t send your computer a message directly. OpenBazaar still works without accepting incoming connections, but the messages won’t be received in real time unless you accept incoming connections.  If you can’t accept incoming connections, then other OpenBazaar nodes think you’re offline, and they send their message into the distributed hash table (DHT). Your node will periodically check the DHT and see the new messages, which is why there is a delay. This is also why restarting OpenBazaar will often retrieve those messages; one of the first things OpenBazaar does when it opens up it check the DHT for new messages.Fixing delays in messagingThere are a few ways to improve messaging. The best way is to do something called port forwarding. Setting up port forwarding allows you to receive messages from the OpenBazaar network in real time. There’s only one port you need to forward:  Port 4001, TCPThis is done by going into your router settings. Google “How to port forward” if you need help. You may also need to add an exception to your firewall to accomplish the same goal. You can check if you’ve successfully opened the port by using this tool and entering port 4001 in the “Port to check” field.If you’re unable to port forward, don’t worry – OpenBazaar will still work for you. But you will need to be aware that orders and chat messages will be delayed. If you get a message from a buyer about an order that you don’t see yet, be patient and wait to see if the order comes in. If you don’t see anything after an hour, try restarting your OpenBazaar client.If a buyer says they sent a message or a made an order that never shows up on your end, make sure that both you and the buyer have up to date versions of OpenBazaar, you’ve both restarted OpenBazaar and you’ve waited at least one hour. Many times the problem is the buyer’s message wasn’t sent properly the first time and a restart should send a new message.3) Your store is always online, sort ofSince you run your store on your own computer, what happens when you shutdown your computer? You might expect that your store would be unreachable to other people, and you’d be right – at least you would have been for previous versions of OpenBazaar. Now OpenBazaar stores can be accessible – and even take orders – when they’re offline. How’s that even possible in a P2P network?In the 2.0 we have built on top of a new technology called IPFS. This technology allows offline stores and listings to be reseeded (shared) by other online OpenBazaar users. When you view another store or listing, you are automatically reseeding that store to the rest of the network if they go offline. There are also some “push nodes” that allow people to automatically push their new listings onto them and they’ll be reseeded (regular users are not push nodes).This results in a network where most content doesn’t goes completely offline unless the vendor leaves the network for more than one week.  Right now, most content will get reseeded for a week before it gets dropped entirely. This means that vendors must open up the OpenBazaar app at least once a week in order for their listings to be available to the rest of the network.However, there are plenty of reasons to try to keep your store running as much as possible. Obviously, being able to respond quickly to your customers is important in any business, and if you’re not running OpenBazaar then you won’t know when new orders come in (unless you set up email integration). Also, orders placed when offline can cost more than online orders, since they use a 1-of-2 multisig (more on that later) so you’re paying for one extra coin transaction fee.  More information  Because of the need to design for stores that are able to be both online and offline, there are a few quirks that a user might not expect. One such quirk is how reviews work. If anything on a vendor’s node changes, then everyone who was reseeding that node now has an outdated copy and needs to get a new copy. On the IPFS network, this is all determined by hashes. Changing anything changes the hash, which makes existing nodes caches outdated. For large changes such a new listings or other changes completed by the vendor, this isn’t a problem, as the vendor would want the new hash to be the valid one, replacing the old. But when there are minor changes, or changes that are forced from the outside (such as someone leaving a review) then forcing the hash to change each time would be a problem. Because of this we batch small changes (such as reviews) and only change the store hash once the vendor publishes something themselves. This keeps store hashes and reseeded content accurate for longer at the cost of the not displaying the newest information. A vendor will need to make a change in their store and save it for new reviews to display.4) OpenBazaar is still a niche communityThe primary advantage of existing ecommerce platforms is their size. They have millions of users, so your products are more likely to be seen on those platforms than on OpenBazaar.Because of this reality we don’t recommend that people transition completely from the old platforms onto OpenBazaar (unless they are selling something cryptocurrency-related), but instead place their listings on both platforms. If you sell your OB listings at a discount and then message your customers on the old platforms, you might be able to grow a new customer base on OpenBazaar and eventually make the transition complete.Vendors need to take marketing and advertising into their own hands and work to spread the word about their store outside of the OpenBazaar platform. OpenBazaar is a cryptocurrency-based marketplace, and the reality is that the world is only beginning to adopt this new form of money. You should not expect to list an item on OpenBazaar and receive substantial sales without making your store or listings known to buyers. The most successful OpenBazaar vendors bring existing customers into the network.5) Cryptocurrency is awesome and sometimes confusingEventually OpenBazaar will allow any cryptocurrency for purchases, but currently all orders on OpenBazaar are settled in Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Zcash as chosen by the vendor. OpenBazaar has a cryptocurrenc wallet already built-in, which makes it easy to fund for buying things. Using this wallet is straightforward, but there are a few aspects of managing your funds and orders that could confuse you.First, your incoming orders. When someone clicks “Pay” after they’ve clicked “Buy Now” then they have placed an order, which will show up in your Sales tab even if they never continue and pay for the order.There are two possible reasons you are seeing an order that is unfunded. The first is that the buyer simply never paid and it’s an abandoned order. The second is that the buyer did pay, but your store isn’t seeing the payment on the coin network yet.You will often need to wait for one confirmation on the payment before it displays as funded, so don’t expect orders to show as funded until they’ve confirmed. If the buyer paid a low fee and / or there is congestion on the network, the process of confirmation could take up to several hours.It’s also possible that your store missed the payment altogether. In this case, it will need to reload transactions. Your store will automatically try to reload transactions periodically if it sees an unfunded order. If you have a buyer telling you they’ve paid an order and you don’t see the payment, you can go into Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; then click “Reload Transactions” and wait 10-15 minutes for the wallet to find the missing transaction. Don’t close the app while this process is happening.Bitcoin Fees, Bitcoin Cash Fees, Zcash FeesOne part of cryptocurrency that can be confusing is the transaction fees. In order to send a payment through the Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Zcash network, you need to include a fee. Fees go to miners who are securing the network and making sure transactions aren’t fraudulent. These fees vary based on how many other people are trying to send coins at the moment. Fees are often less than $1, but on some networks can also be over $1 or even $3 to $5 at times.  More information  Your fee also depends on how many inputs are needed to make the transaction. If you only have one input then the fee will be lower, but if you create a transaction with multiple inputs then the fee will be higher, sometimes much higher. By default you won’t use multiple inputs, but if you’ve made a lot of transactions your wallet with have several small change outputs, and of those are combined to make a new input then the fees will be higher.You can partially control how much you want to pay in fees by determining how fast you want the payment to be confirmed by the network. If you want it confirmed as soon as possible (usually less than ten minutes) then you will choose a Priority fee. If you don’t mind waiting a half hour or so, then you can choose a Normal fee. If you don’t mind confirmation taking a few hours, you can choose the Economic fee. You can change your fee settings by going into Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced, choosing your fee and pressing Save.If your buyers have chosen a low fee then their payments may not confirm for hours and those funds will not be spendable from your OpenBazaar wallet until they’ve received one confirmation.There are three types of payments in OpenBazaar, and it’s important to understand how fees impact these payments:  Direct payments  Moderated payments  Offline paymentsDirect paymentsDirect payments are a buyer sending coins to the vendor and both parties are online. There is only one fee paid and the buyer pays it on top of the price of the item.Moderated paymentsModerated payments occur when the buyer selects a moderator and payment goes into escrow. There are two fees paid, one is paid by the buyer when they fund the escrow and the other is taken out of the total amount in escrow when funds are released. Assuming there isn’t a dispute and funds are released to the vendor, then effectively the vendor has paid the second fee, since they receive the total in the escrow minus the cost of the fee.Here’s an example: let’s say you’re selling a painting for $100. Someone purchases your painting; they choose a moderated payment and pay $100 plus a $1.50 fee that goes to the coin miners. The $100 are now securely in the escrow. You ship your painting and the buyer receives it, is happy with their order and they release the funds. Since you shipped the painting the coin fees have increased slightly, so when funds were released to you a $1.75 fee was taken out of the total $100 and you receive $98.25 in your wallet.Two out of three parties are always needed to release funds from a moderated order, so if one of the parties goes unresponsive and doesn’t release funds then the other party will be forced to open a dispute with the moderator. A moderator will charge a fee (which comes out of the total escrowed funds) to close a dispute, so it’s in both parties interest to be responsive and not abandon orders.Offline paymentsThere is a third type of payment: Offline payments. These happen when the vendor is offline. If the buyer makes a moderated payment to an offline vendor then it acts the same as a regular moderated payment. If the buyer makes a direct payment to an offline vendor, then the funds are put into a temporary escrow account that either buyer or vendor can pull from. If the vendor comes back online they can either accept or reject the offline order. If they accept and fulfill the order, then they receive the payment and receive the funds minus a fee. If the vendor never comes back online (or they reject the offline order when they come back online), then the buyer pulls the funds back, and they receive the funds minus a fee. Doing an offline payment means one party will be paying an extra fee, so it’s better for the vendor to be online for orders if possible.OpenBazaar is a new and growing network populated by lots of great people who are looking to have more control over how they buy and sell online.

                "title": "8 Reasons Why OpenBazaar 2.0 Is Better Than 1.0", 
                "content": "The first version of OpenBazaar launched in April of 2016 and has been used by tens of thousands of people around the world since then.But building the world’s first fully decentralized marketplace is no simple task, and the first version had some limitations. After 250,000+ downloads of version 1.0 we received huge amount of feedback and suggestions–and we’ve taken them to heart. The culmination of this effort is OpenBazaar 2.0, which is a leap forward upon the first version. Here are 8 reasons why OpenBazaar 2.0 is better than the first version.1. Your OpenBazaar Store is Available 24/7The OpenBazaar network is completely peer-to-peer with no middleman. This is great of course, but it used to mean that they needed to be on a computer that was running constantly. In 2.0 stores can still be accessible even when they aren’t online. This is possible due to us building the OpenBazaar 2.0 network on top of a new technology called IPFS.IPFS gives OpenBazaar users the ability for their stores and listings to be reseeded by other OpenBazaar users, which happens automatically when you visit another person’s store. Then even if their store goes offline it’s still accessible if others are reseeding it.2. Even More Privacy with TorTor is a tool that gives users more privacy online. Now OpenBazaar users can run OpenBazaar over Tor to give them even more control over their own privacy.OpenBazaar doesn’t use Tor by default though. If you want to use Tor with OpenBazaar on Windows, check out this guide. For Ubuntu or OSX users you can use this guide.3. Improved and Integrated Search ExperienceSearch is now built into the client itself and there are multiple search providers that users can easily switch between.4. A Built-In Wallet Makes Transactions Even EasierIn the old version of OpenBazaar people would use an external wallet for their transactions, but the new version has a built-in wallet. This makes transactions incredibly simple by just clicking “Pay from Wallet.”It also empowers OpenBazaar users to make more complex transactions than they could with an external wallet, such as managing 1-of-2 multisig transactions for offline ordering or using the latest Segwit format.5. Simplified Store ManagementVendors now have more tools to help them manage their stores, such as inventory management, variants, coupon codes, and detailed shipping options.6. Easier To Install, Improved StabilityCreating a completely decentralized marketplace is difficult. There are many different operating systems and versions, and every user’s networking setup is unique, leading to an incredible number of possible scenarios to consider. Version 2.0 is substantially improved over the old version in terms of ease of installation and stability. There are many factors behind this improvement, but the bottom line is that our developer community has been working hard for a long time to get it to this point.7. Interface Redesigned for SimplicityWe received a lot of feedback on how to improve the design of version 1.0 and worked to incorporate much of it into a clean, modern layout. Users will find the experience of shopping and selling on OpenBazaar much improved.8. Totally Free Ecommerce on More DevicesPeer-to-peer technology is an important new evolution for internet users. We’re excited to be pioneering how people can safely and securely connect their devices directly to one another around the world and we started by building OpenBazaar version 1.0 as a desktop application. Now, because 2.0 is based on IPFS and has incorporated a few other backend design choices, we will soon be able to run OpenBazaar on both mobile and the web. The mobile and web versions are still being built, but once release should make it even easier for people to join the world’s largest decentralized marketplace online.Try out these new features right now!

If you try the beta, please note the warnings and follow the guidelines and tutorial on the beta page.The beta uses real Bitcoin and real listings.If you use the beta and run into a problem, please report the issue in the OpenBazaar 2.0 beta Megathread on our subreddit, or use the built-in “Feedback” button in the client.Known IssuesThere are a few known issues with the beta that we are working to fix before the full release. Please be aware of these issues if you test the beta.  Fee estimation is tricky business and currently tends to estimate too high. We’re working on a fix.  Moderated payments should only be used for higher-value transaction, since they use multisig and require two transactions, doubling the Bitcoin fee paid and reducing the final amount the vendor receives. If the transaction is small enough, moderated payments (and dispute resolution) won’t work at all. We will soon introduce a limit preventing users from selecting moderated payments under a certain amount.  You may see the error “Too many files open” on OSX or Linux. Usually if you wait a few minutes and try the action again, this issue resolves itself. IPFS is already working on a solution to this issue, and we’ll implement it as soon as possible.New featuresOpenBazaar 2.0 includes many significant improvements over the first version.Offline storesBecause this new version is built on IPFS, OpenBazaar stores can now be accessible to buyers even when they are offline. Stores and listings can now be re-seeded by other OpenBazaar users, meaning that if a store is seeded then buyers can purchase their listings even if they are offline.SearchThird party search providers are now accessible from within the client. Search results are much faster and more accurate than they were before.TorYou can now use Tor with OpenBazaar 2.0 for more privacy.

We went back to the drawing board and recreated the search experience from the ground up.When OpenBazaar 1.0 launched in April 2016, 3rd party developers identified the challenges around building a truly decentralized search experience and proceeded to build centralized services that crawl and curate listings across many stores on the network.BazaarBay launched the first search engine built specifically for the OpenBazaar platform. DuoSearch and Mubiz followed shortly after.When re-thinking search in OpenBazaar 2.0, instead of re-creating another less than ideal experience, we were strongly in favor of optimizing for the best possible user experience. Utilizing 3rd party search engines would deliver the best user experience while also helping the 3rd party ecosystem grow around OpenBazaar.This results in: faster load times, better curation, shop by category, customized search filtering, improved spam prevention, better sorting, fuzzy search and much more.Here’s a sneak preview of the UI:Notice how easy it is to toggle between search engines. Each search engine ranks listings differently and provide a unique set of search filters.When shopping on eCommerce platforms such as Amazon or eBay, we’re forced to use their built in search engine, which may be artificially ranking their internal brands or highest paying partners higher than independent sellers.In OpenBazaar, we avoid the favoritism issues by supporting a rich ecosystem of search providers.This just scratches the surface of what is capable with search in OpenBazaar 2.0. We hope to see many more search engines spin up in the near future!In the next search related post, we’ll dive under the hood and explain how to create and layer in your own search engine into OpenBazaar.

                "content": "Segregated Witness has thankfully activated on the Bitcoin network before the release of OpenBazaar 2.0. This has given us an opportunity to upgrade OpenBazaar to make use of segwit before putting it in the hands of users.Had segwit activated later, it would have made upgrading to segwit much more difficult as all parties to an escrow transaction (the buyer, vendor, and moderator) would need upgrade before segwit could be used. This would also necessitate the need to build in more complex script negotiations to get all parties to agree on what type of script to use. By implementing segwit now we can, hopefully, reduce the fees users will pay to transact on OpenBazaar.SpecificsFor multisig transactions OpenBazaar will use Bech32 encoded pay-to-witness-script-hash (P2WSH) addresses.The downside to using this address type is that many external wallets are not yet upgraded to send to these addresses. However, the OpenBazaar internal wallet is, so the worse case scenario if you don’t currently use a segwit compatible wallet is that you can send the coins into the OpenBazaar internal wallet and fund your transaction from there.For the time being the internal wallet will continue to vend old-style pay-to-pubkey-hash (P2PKH) addresses. We would like to switch to pay-to-witness-pubkey-hash (P2WPKH) addresses but, again, few external wallets support sending to this address type and it would make it difficult for people to send money into the wallet. We could switch to using nested P2SH addresses, but this would be a very disruptive change to our codebase and the benefits aren’t really worth the cost at this point.Once enough other wallets have enabled sending to P2WPKH we will switch the internal wallet over to P2WPKH. We’ve already done some prep work that will make the transition to the new address type seamless as the wallet will know how to detect payments to and spend from both P2PKH and P2WPKH addresses.Escrow with a timeoutOne related change that we have made but never formally announced is that OpenBazaar2.0 will utilize bip-112 CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY to add a 45 day (in blocks) timeout to escrow transactions.One of the big pain points in OpenBazaar v1 was vendors having stuck funds when both a buyer and moderator went unresponsive. By adding a 45 day timeout to the escrow, the vendor will be able to unilaterally move the funds out of escrow and into his wallet after 45 days regardless of whether the buyer and moderator are active or not.This leaves buyers with 45 days to file a dispute if they have issues with their order (less if they allot time for the dispute resolution process).The new scripts look like:`OP_IF2  3 OP_CHECKMULTISIG  OP_ELSE  &lt;6480 blocks&gt; OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY  OP_DROP  OP_CHECKSIG  OP_ENDIF`If you have any questions or feedback feel free to drop by the [OpenBazaar Slack](http://slack.openbazaar.org/).",

                "title": "Is OpenBazaar a Darknet Market?", 
                "content": "OpenBazaar is a new way to do commerce online, and people are often unclear exactly how it is different from traditional ecommerce platforms. We sometimes have people look at the features of this network and confuse OpenBazaar with so-called “darknet markets.”What are darknet markets, and how is OpenBazaar different?Darknet MarketsMarketplaces which cater to people engaged in illicit activity have been around for thousands of years, and it’s no surprise that in the digital age they can also be found online.Since the early days of the public Internet there have been forums and communities of people discussing cybercrime and other illegal activity. In recent years a combination of new technologies gave rise to a new type of marketplace called the darknet market. Darknet markets have the following characteristics:  They cater to illicit commerce, mostly focused on drugs.  They are centralized marketplaces controlled by an individual or small group and run for profit.  They require the use of technology such as Tor to access the market in order to keep the marketplace (and its users) anonymous.  The payment method for transactions is cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin.The Silk Road, launched in 2011, was the first darknet market. It was taken down by law enforcement a few years later. Other darknet markets have sprung up since, but many are shut down by law enforcement eventually.Of the darknet markets that aren’t shut down, several performed what is called an “exit scam” by abruptly shutting down the site and taking all of the users’ Bitcoin deposits, in some cases worth millions of dollars.Is OpenBazaar a Darknet Market?Of the four characteristics of darknet markets explained above, OpenBazaar currently only has one thing in common with darknet markets: It uses Bitcoin for payments.Otherwise, it differs in some important ways:  It doesn’t cater to illicit commerce.  It isn’t a centralized marketplace run for profit.  It doesn’t use anonymizing technology by default.  Exit scams aren’t even possible because no central organization controls the OpenBazaar network or escrow system.Darknet markets and OpenBazaar differ in another way as well. In a darknet market the marketplace operator takes on the most risk by running the site. They are the target for law enforcement, and it means the users of the platform take on less risk by only needing to access the darknet market via a special web browser. OpenBazaar is different; anyone using the software for illicit commerce needs to run the software on their own computer (or a virtual private server they rent) and carry some of that risk themselves. There is no marketplace operator for law enforcement to target, but each individual user engaged in illicit commerce could become a target instead.OpenBazaar 1.0 has existed for over a year now, and the vast majority of trade on the network is simple consumer goods and services. At any given time less than 5% of listings on the network are considered “NSFW,” and many of those are legal but, well… not safe for work!The upcoming version 2.0 release does add another point in common with darknet markets: people will be able to use Tor with OpenBazaar. However, Tor is not on by default and is not required to access the network; it’s an option for users who care deeply about their privacy. This allows users to select their own level of privacy on the network.Illicit Commerce Not Exclusive to Darknet MarketsOften when discussing darknet markets it’s easy to forget the fact that illicit commerce happens on the regular Internet as well. In fact, due to the relatively small size of darknet markets and the vast size of the regular Internet, it’s possible that the majority of illicit activity online isn’t conducted in darknet markets at all.ISIS terrorist have used eBay to help fund their operations. Instagram has been a popular advertising service for drug dealers for years. It’s not alone: Facebook, Craigslist, Snapchat, and basically all popular communications platforms online have been used for dealing drugs or other illicit activity. No matter what the protocol, network, or platform are intended to be used for, people can use them in unintended ways.The websites mentioned above are centrally controlled and can take some steps to reduce illicit activity on their own platforms. OpenBazaar is not centrally controlled and so no one is able to directly stop illicit activity on the network, but there are still ways to minimize illicit use of the platform.One such method is the use of search engines refusing to index listings or stores they don’t want their users to see. The default method of product discovery in the upcoming 2.0 release is through third party search providers, and those providers are likely to remove any listings that violate the laws in their jurisdictions, meaning most OpenBazaar users won’t be able to access them on the network unless they intentionally bypass the search engines themselves. OpenBazaar users will also be able to manually block stores to prevent them from displaying ever again, and can report listings to the search providers as well.OpenBazaar is a protocol and network for trade. It’s a neutral technology that can be used for many types of transactions and it’s not built to cater to any particular type of commerce. So far, this has meant that the OpenBazaar network tends to reflect society in general: a few people engage in illicit activity, but the vast majority don’t.OpenBazaar was built to be a global marketplace for free trade. The users of the agnostic protocol and network determine what OpenBazaar looks like. We’re excited to watch the future of ecommerce unfold.",

                "content": "If you’re part of our Alpha or Beta testers, we’d like to thank you for helping us make sure the 2.0 release of the OpenBazaar platform is as high-quality as possible. If you are not a tester, but would like to be, click here to learn how you can participate.This post will help make testing as simple as possible, and also ensure that your testing provides valuable information for the OpenBazaar development team. We’ll cover how to install and run OpenBazaar, how / what to test, and how to report feedback.Please note that vendors looking to create stores before 2.0 launches must wait until the Beta launch or later; any stores created during the Alpha testing period will not be usable when the network launches for real.InstallationThis alpha testing phase is limited to prevent an overwhelming amount of feedback to the developers, and testers will receive the installer links via email. When beta testing begins, we will update this post with links to the installers. If you aren’t included in the alpha testing but are trying to build a service using OpenBazaar, contact the developers and we’ll be sure to include you.Using the installer is simple. Click the link to download the file, and then open the file when it has finished downloading. In a few moments, OpenBazaar should install and begin running.The first time you run OpenBazaar, it might take longer than expected to start properly. You may see something like the following image:OpenBazaar is actually two programs that users run on your computer, the client (what you see) and the server (which does the work in the background). This message means that the client is running, but the server hasn’t started properly yet. Wait a few seconds, then click the “Retry” button, and your client and server should connect. If this doesn’t work after a few tries, then your server might not be starting at all and you should report this to our developers (see “Reporting” section below).TestingNow that OpenBazaar is installed, you can begin testing. You will first go through a quick onboarding process, which you can fill out as you would when using the final product.In the alpha testing phase the test builds will automatically use testnet Bitcoins, not real Bitcoins. This is to prevent accidental loss of funds. You can use the built-in wallet to create an address to receive testnet coins by clicking the wallet button on the top right first, then clicking “Receive Money” on the left side of the wallet interface (note the buttons highlighted in red below):You’ll see a QR code as well as a testnet Bitcoin address. Copy the testnet Bitcoin address, it should start with a “m” unlike a regular Bitcoin address:With this address, you can visit a testnet faucet and receive some free testnet Bitcoin to use. Paste the address into their service and you should receive enough testnet Bitcoins to start. Typically, these coins arrive quickly, but the testnet occasionally has problems and it may take minutes or hours to arrive.The Bitcoin testnet can be unreliable, and if you find a problem with the wallet or transactions, it’s not always clear whether it’s a problem with the OpenBazaar code or a problem with testnet. In order to help us distinguish between the two, before you report a problem with the wallet or transactions please visit your settings &gt; advanced, and click “Show Block Data,” then copy the output and include this text in your report.When testing, use the platform as you expect you’ll use it when it’s finished. For thoroughness, you can use the following testing script:Use search  Search for various items  Open a listing from search results  Use filters and “sort by” featuresTest wallet  Receive funds (explained above)  Send funds  Review transactions to ensure accuracy (confirmations, exchange rate price, amount, etc)          Note that transactions may not be instant if the testnet blockchain isn’t working properly      Ordering  Click the buy button  Purchase a listing and change quantity / variants  Pay from internal wallet  Pay from external wallet  Check purchases in Purchases section, open orders          After paying for a purchase, click the Purchases link or click Purchases in the top right navigation menu to go to the Purchases screen        Message vendor through order section (after placing an order, you can send the vendor a message)Create listings  Create physical listing with variants and multiple shipping options  Create digital listing  Create service listing  Add multiple photos to each listing   Browse and select a moderator in the store settingsManage listings (this section requires someone to purchase your test listings)  Open sales tab  Open orders  Refund order  Confirm order  Open a dispute  Message buyer through order sectionTest settings  Change settings in each section, saving each timeChat  Navigate to a user and message them (you can use search or the “Connected Peers” option in the menu)  Click chat avatars to navigate to user pages  Delete conversationReportingThere are multiple ways to report your feedback to the OpenBazaar development team. Please read the descriptions below to determine which method is best for your specific feedback.Built-in feedback toolDuring testing, the OpenBazaar client includes a built-in tool for giving feedback. Click the “Feedback” button on the bottom right of the client, and you’ll see a form appear: This is the preferred reporting method when you’ve found bugs or something not working correctly during testing. Please include your operating system, a description of what happened, and what you were doing when it happened.Ideally you would take a screenshot of the error or problem you see, and then include that screenshot using the “Upload files” section of the form. You can also upload logs or text files if you have them. You can use the “Attach a screenshot” option at the bottom, but they are lower quality than manually attached screenshots and not preferred.If you’re willing to talk to the developers about the bug you found, please include your email address so we can respond to you.Help DeskIf you don’t have a bug to report, but wish to give us more detailed feedback on your testing experience, or have questions for the development team, you can use our help desk. In the subject line, please mention that this is testing feedback. If you’d like a response, indicate that in your message. This method is also good for reporting more complicated or serious problems found in testing that need you to include a log file or other detailed information. To use this method you will need to include your email address.SlackOur community slack is always open to talk to other members of the OpenBazaar community. Our developers can be reached there as well, but we strongly prefer that users first use the other reporting methods for testing feedback first, as the developers are busy trying to finish building the product. If you need troubleshooting help, the slack is a good place to ask others who might have had the same problem.GithubAll the code for OpenBazaar is open source and on Github (server and client). We ask users not to open github issues to submit testing feedback. We always welcome developers submitting pull requests or opening issues to address technical problems.",

                "title": "Trust is Risk: A Decentralized Trust System", 
                "content": "One of the foundational problems of a decentralized marketplace is that of trust.It’s an inherently difficult problem:How can you trade with someone who could, in principle, be completely anonymous?In this article, we provide a novel answer to that question, something we call Trust is Risk. It’s a new approach to solve the problem that we’re exploring and we’d like to illustrate our ideas to the community and solicit your feedback.This post is going to give an explanation of what Trust Is Risk is and how it works with quite some detail. This post is accessible to anyone. We don’t have any math here. But if you’re interested in all the deep details, I’m providing links to our papers in the last section that you can look at.This is novel research work we’ve been doing that has never been presented before outside of academic conferences. We’d greatly appreciate your feedback and constructive criticism of our ideas.Before we begin, a disclaimer: Trust Is Risk is an exploratory subject. OpenBazaar is considering it for research, but is not yet committed to adopting it. More work is needed to evaluate if this system can work in practice.The problem and previous attempts at solving itIn a traditional brick-and-mortar store setting, you have certain insurances that will let you transact safely. If something goes wrong, for example the store rips you off, you have a whole legal arsenal that you can bring against the store. But we don’t have (and perhaps don’t want to have) that luxury in a decentralized marketplace when people can anonymously connect through Tor or use cryptocoins that ensure privacy such as monero or zcash (which OpenBazaar already supports). Besides, if we allowed people to be accountable towards traditional courts and law, we’re opening up pandora’s box in letting governments interfere by making their own laws about what’s “cheating in a transaction” and what isn’t, which leaves room for censorship, something OpenBazaar always wanted to avoid – which is why from OpenBazaar’s inception we considered malicious governments as part of our threat model.Brick-and-mortar stores also have a certain cost to set up and you expect them to be there the next day for accountability. You can literally walk up to a store that sold you a faulty phone and ask for your money back. But OpenBazaar stores can appear out of nowhere and disappear in minutes. We gave a lot of thought to these features of the physical world during the first versions of OpenBazaar and came up with reputation pledges and implemented one of the first production proof-of-burn systems for identity creation. But people feel very uncomfortable burning money to set up a digital store and we discovered some alternative ideas like donating to charity or miners can’t work out securely.Here are some critical questions: If you’re a buyer, how do you know that when you give them the money, they’re going to send you the product? Or if you’re a vendor, how do you know that when you ship them the product, they’ll give you the money they promised? Of course you can use transaction-based escrows such as 2-of-2 or 2-of-3 transactions or MAD, some of which OpenBazaar already implements. But the problem remains: What if as a buyer you use a 2-of-2 transaction and upon receiving the product you finalize your funds, only to find out days later that it was of bad quality and broke down?Another idea is to use a web-of-trust and I wrote extensively about the potential of using it in OpenBazaar in my master thesis (of which the shorter version is much more palatable). But the problem there, as with GPG, is that trust is arbitrary: it’s just a number and everybody has a different idea about how much to trust others and what trust means. For example, some people are very diligent about giving out trust, while others aren’t. An arbitrary trust scale doesn’t mean the same to everybody. And so the problem remains unsolved.Sybil attacks and starsCurrently OpenBazaar uses a reputation system which is based on ratings and stars. This is a system widely employed by centralized markets as well, from eBay to Facebook Marketplaces. The idea is to let other people rate you from 1★ to 5★ as a buyer or as a vendor after a transaction is completed. Then, an average can be extracted and displayed for everyone.This star-based system is quite attractive due to its simplicity and ease of understanding. Centralized marketplaces can afford this system, because they can refactor it and censor users at will if they gauge that people are misbehaving. They can also employ secret heuristic mechanisms to detect and punish wrongdoing. However, a decentralized market does not have such an option, as the code and exact inner workings must be open.This opens up a star-based system to Sybil attacks. In this attack, a malicious vendor works as follows: They create multiple fake “buyer” accounts which perform transactions with the vendor. They then have the buyer accounts positively rate the vendor, increasing their star rating. The fact that a transaction is required prior to rating someone does not help defend against this attack. The seller simply moves funds among different Bitcoin addresses all of which they control. As OpenBazaar does not require paying any fees this is essentially free (except for Bitcoin transaction fees).Many naïve ideas can be proposed for avoiding Sybil attacks. Here’s one: If a vendor receives many ratings simultaneously from users that all have newly created accounts, then these ratings can be discounted. Here’s another one: A buyer must have made a minimum of 5 other purchases before they can rate this vendor. Here’s yet another: A buyer must have already rated another vendor prior to having his ratings count. And one more: If the buyer and seller form an isolated strongly connected “island” of ratings (a so-called clique), then the ratings should be discounted. These proposals are lucrative, but can’t possibly work. The rules for deciding which ratings are good and which ones are bad must be published in the open source code of the project. Subsequently, the malicious vendor can make sure they bypass such rules. For example, they will make sure they let their accounts “mature” before rating, they will create several fake vendor accounts so that their fake sellers can create ratings towards the fake vendors prior to making ratings to the real vendor and they will avoid forming a “clique” of ratings by not having everyone rate everyone, but rather mimic the way real people rate real vendors in terms of amount of ratings, connectedness, and so forth. The same problems arise if you try to filter by IP address or require that people run a different OpenBazaar node version or OS version. It’s a futile cat-and-mouse game.Trusting peopleThe core idea of Trust is Risk is quite simple. We believe this is the right approach for handling decentralized trust. Here it is.Suppose Bob shares a bank account with his friend Alice. He puts 10€ in it, which are his own, but just trusts Alice not to take it. Because Alice is his friend, she doesn’t take it. While Alice can always take it, she chooses not to. Even though it’s put in a shared account, Bob’s money is always Bob’s and he can always take it too.In Bitcoin, we can do the same thing with a transaction that has a 1-of-2 multisig output. A 1-of-2 multisig output means that the money is spendable by either one of the two participants on their own, Alice or Bob. Alice doesn’t need Bob’s permission to spend and Bob doesn’t need Alice’s permission to spend. Here’s what that looks like in the Bitcoin transaction graph:Here, Bob has created a transaction into which he pays 1 BTC so that the money can now belong to an account shared between Alice and Bob. Whenever we mention a “shared account” in this post, we mean such 1-of-2 multisig transaction outputs.We call this a trust transaction, because Bob trusts Alice with his money. The use of such transactions, reminiscent of lines-of-credit in more traditional settings, for the purpose of establishing trust was a great idea invented by OpenBazaar co-founder Washington Sanchez in his post Peer-to-Peer Lending on OpenBazaar.Suppose now, in this limited setting, that Bob wishes to purchase something from Alice, and that Bob has already entrusted Alice with 1 coin at an earlier moment in time. If what he wants to buy from Alice is worth 1 coin, then he can do it as follows: He takes the money out of the shared account and pays it directly to Alice’s account (or simply tells Alice that it’s fine to take it out of the shared account). Then Alice can get paid and ship the product.That doesn’t sound like a big deal, because Bob and Alice were already friends, but think about what just happened: Bob was willingly trusting Alice with some money, a trust decision he took in the past. If that trust decision on Bob’s side was the right call, then Alice will not cheat on him and will not take the money out of the account. Therefore, merely by having the money in a shared account, Bob has established an amount of trust for Alice.He can then use that money and buy something from Alice, knowing that Alice won’t steal from him in the product trade. Why? Because if Alice had wanted to steal from him, she could’ve done so previously anyway. We call this property risk invariance, because Bob’s risk exposure towards Alice does not change before and after the purchase. Before the purchase, Bob was willingly taking a risk of 1 coin, because it was in a shared account with Alice. After the purchase, Bob is again taking a risk of 1 coin, because he is waiting for a product worth 1 coin to arrive, but has removed the money from the shared account. In both cases, Bob was trusting Alice by risking 1 coin and nothing changed. When Bob receives the product, this closes the trade and he can replenish the trust by opening a new shared account with Alice, if he wants to.The Trust is Risk walletBased on the very simple idea above, we know that people have friends that they are willing to trust financially. This is a very different situation from more traditional webs-of-trust, such as GPG, where trust is an arbitrary numeric value. Now trust is established as a monetary value, it is denominated in bitcoin, and everyone is equal in it. If Alice trusts Bob with 1 coin, and Charlie trusts Dave with 1 coin, that’s 1 coin everywhere. It has the same purchasing power. In this sense, we utilize money’s unit of account property to equalize what trust means for different people. Yes, maybe different people are less willing to trust others, but we now have a quantifiable means of establishing how much they trust each other without ever having to know their personality intricacies. We thus leverage the objective nature of money in order to “objectify” trust.Imagine now that we provide a new generation of bitcoin wallets. This wallet is called the Trust is Risk wallet. You can move money back and forth between your traditional wallet and your Trust is Risk wallet to your heart’s content. But your Trust is Risk wallet is different: In it, your money can be put in shared accounts with your friends via trust transactions. So, for example, if Alice has 60 mBTC stored in her Trust is Risk wallet, she could have allocated 36 mBTC of it to Charlie and 24 mBTC of it to Bob. That money is under risk: Alice is choosing her friends to put some of her own money under their control, and hopefully she’s choosing wisely. Here’s how her wallet could display her portfolio:Here, she’s putting 36 mBTC in a shared account with Charlie and another 24 mBTC in a shared account with Bob, for a total of 60 mBTC.Trust transactions have an additional cryptographic property: They can be used to prove to third parties that a trust relationship exists between two people. Hence, if Alice and Bob maintain a shared account where Alice’s money is stored, they can publicize the respective Bitcoin transaction and everybody can know that Alice trusts Bob a certain amount of money. For reasons that will become clear below, we want to publicize all these trust relationships in OpenBazaar by default. One easy way to do that is to associate a fixed Bitcoin address with each OpenBazaar node and use that as-is in all trust transactions. There are also better ways of doing it using unique addresses that are verified to belong to their respective owners with a signature. Showing these transactions to third parties constitutes a proof-of-trust and is a powerful new primitive.Trust transitivityYou may be asking: Why would I ever put my money in a Trust is Risk wallet? That sounds like a silly, unnecessary risk. But you get a unique benefit from that. If you’re willing to risk some money by having some exposure to known friends, then we can solve the decentralized trust problem. This is the crux of this reputation system.Here’s how it works: You trust some money to each of your friends. They trust some money to their own friends and perhaps back to you. Their friends trust their own friends, and so on, forming a big network of trust similar to cryptographic webs-of-trust. However, this network is now associated with financial values.Technically, we say that the web-of-trust forms a trust graph of people connected through lines-of-credit. Here’s how that graph looks like if Alice trusts Bob with 10 coins and Bob trusts Charlie with 20 coins:Unlike the previous graph where we were showing a Bitcoin transaction with inputs and outputs, here the circles correspond to OpenBazaar accounts and the arrows correspond to lines-of-credit (also known as direct trusts) extended between them.But now that we have two steps in the trust graph, something interesting happens: Alice not only trusted Bob with her money, but she also trusted Bob about his financial trust decisions. Imagine the following case: say Charlie decides to steal the money that Bob has deposited into their shared account. In this case Bob has incorrectly trusted Charlie by putting his money into their shared account. Then Bob has a spectrum of options with two extremes. In the first extreme, Bob can, in turn, take Alice’s money deposited in the account shared between Alice and Bob in order to replenish his loss. Of course, this is a worst-case scenario for Alice. The other extreme option for Bob is to decide to absorb the loss, which is a better scenario for Alice. Nevertheless, Alice is in practice exposed to some risk due to Charlie’s behavior through her trust in Bob. She not only has entrusted Bob with her money in good faith that he won’t steal it, but also gone a step further, trusting him with her money to make his own investments. But in any case, Alice’s liability is limited to the amount she has put in that account she shared with Bob. She can explicitly set a bound on how much Bob’s mishaps can cost her.These two distinct options for Bob often arise in real-world economic scenarios. Suppose there is a client, an intermediary and a producer. The client entrusts some value to the intermediary so that the latter can buy the desired product from the producer and deliver it to the client. The intermediary in turn entrusts an equal value to the producer, who needs the value upfront to be able to complete the production process. However, for whatever reason, the producer eventually does not ship the product and neither reimburses its value. This could be due to bankruptcy or an illegal decision to exit the market with an unfair benefit. The intermediary can then choose either to reimburse the client and suffer the loss, or refuse to return the money and perhaps lose the client’s trust. Because losses can be passed down the line, we call this a transitive trust game.Trust transitivity, especially in a decentralized financial setting, has been explored and supported by empirical sociological research of lending networks. They have independently discovered that our results, which we prove mathematically, empirically arise in real networks of people.The flow of moneyJust as an example, here’s what a slightly more complex trust graph looks like:Here we have an interesting case of a trust cycle: A trusts D, who trusts B, who trusts A.We’ve set up our trust graph. Now suppose you, the user of OpenBazaar, have a Trust is Risk wallet and some of your money is deposited to accounts shared with your friends. And, now, suppose you find some vendor who is also participating in the Trust is Risk network through his own wallet. Of course, you don’t trust that vendor directly. However, there may be indirect lines-of-credit extended to the vendor. Through your financial decision to trust your friends, a move you’ve made comfortably already knowing who they are, you have taken some calculated risk towards some pseudonymous vendor whom you’ve never met. In fact, since the trust transactions are public, your OpenBazaar node can calculate exactly how much this risk is. Calculating the exact risk value is not as easy as looking at each line-of-credit as we did in the simple case with just three people above, but regardless there’s a formula we can use to automatically evaluate it. This evaluation of risk exposure is performed using something we call the trust flow theorem. The risk is an exact value measured in bitcoin.Here’s a fun trivia fact: The way we evaluate the total risk exposure of a buyer towards a vendor is using a fascinating classical graph theory algorithm from the 1950s called the maximum flow algorithm which was invented by Lester Ford and Delbert Fulkerson. They invented this algorithm to solve a completely different problem – the efficiency of the Soviet railway network.Once we’ve calculated how much risk you already have towards a vendor, we can perform the same reasoning as we did previously:  You willingly trusted money to your friends.  This indirectly exposed you to a certain financial risk towards the vendor, which we calculated.  If that vendor was evil and wanted to leave the market with an unfair advantage, which, in the worst case, could cost you your money, they could have already done so.  You can now safely buy from that vendor up to a certain value without incurring additional risk – to pay for the product, just use some of your money from the account shared with your friend.In order to buy from that vendor, you want to keep your risk the same prior to making a purchase and after completing a purchase. We have proven that this is possible in our risk invariance theorem, as long as your risk towards a vendor is higher than the price of the good you wish to purchase. Therefore, your Trust is Risk wallet will automatically pay the vendor by reducing some money you have deposited in the accounts shared with your friends and use that money to pay the vendor directly. The calculation of where to take money from in order to keep your risk constant is performed using a trust redistribution algorithm. For the user, it will be a simple matter of seeing the money leaving some shared friends’ accounts and paying the vendor.One thing to understand is that this trust system is a new paradigm. It does not actively protect the user from mishaps in any way. There’s no way to flag the purchase as fake or talk to an escrow to have a conflict resolved. The only security insurance provided by the system is risk invariance: We’re only ensuring that the risk you were taking by trusting money to your friends is the same as the risk you are taking by making a purchase from an unknown entity. If(and that’s a big if) you have chosen to trust your friends with your money wisely, only then we make sure that the purchase is safe. But if the vendor decides to screw you, there’s nothing we can do about it, except show you a trace of why the vendor was deemed trustworthy, pointing exactly to whom of your friends you should stop trusting now (or whom of their friends they should stop trusting, and so on).Unlike stars, the trust that the buyer is seeing for the vendor is personalized. We call this projected trust, a trust value that is potentially different when two different buyers are browsing the shop of the same vendor. This is a recurring theme in our work. We conjecture, although we have not proven, that secure decentralized trust systems must necessarily use some form of projected trust.Putting it togetherAs you can see, we have approached the problem of trust, a broad and ambiguous concept, by mathematically defining it to be equal to financial risk. When Alice puts money in an account shared with Bob, we say that she directly trusts Bob. But we previously concluded that pseudonymous people far away in the network towards whom Alice has never extended any direct trust can still behave in a way that can cost Alice money – if she made a wrong decision when she decided to trust her friends. We call these indirect trusts.This may all sound complicated, but the end user experience is simple. Let’s go through a purchase of some goods on an imaginary new version of OpenBazaar to see how this could work.We’ll trace Alice’s steps from joining the network to successfully completing a purchase. Suppose initially all her coins, say 100 mBTC, are under her exclusive control in a traditional bitcoin wallet.Two trustworthy friends, Bob and Charlie, persuade her to try out Trust Is Risk. She installs the Trust Is Risk wallet, perhaps even shipped as part of the OpenBazaar program, and migrates 60 mBTC of her 100 mBTC from her regular wallet, entrusting 24 mBTC to Bob and 36 mBTC to Charlie. She now exclusively controls 40 mBTC. She is risking 60 mBTC to which she has full but not exclusive access in exchange for being part of the network. Alice’s wallet is represented by the pie chart we went through above.A few days later, she discovers an online pepper shop, Pepper Palace, owned by Dean, also a member of Trust Is Risk. She finds a nice Carolina Reaper pepper that costs 6 mBTC and checks Dean’s trustworthiness through her new wallet. Suppose Dean is deemed trustworthy up to 20 mBTC. Since 6 mBTC ≤ 20 mBTC, she confidently proceeds to purchase the pepper with her new wallet.We call these “20 mBTC” the allowance our system gives to Alice for making purchases from Dean. If she spends any money up to that amount, we can give risk invariance insurances. Spend money beyond that point and she incurs additional risk, which she can of course choose to take.Hey, by the way, if you’re into peppers, this is a real product you can currently buy on OpenBazaar! She can then see in her wallet that her exclusive coins have remained 40 mBTC. But the coins from her shared account with Charlie have been automatically reduced by 4 mBTC and are now down to 32 mBTC. And the coins in her shared account with Bob have been reduced by 2 mBTC and are now down to 22 mBTC. Dean has been paid 6 mBTC, equal to the value of the pepper. Also, her purchase is marked as pending. Under the hood, her wallet redistributed her entrusted coins in a way that ensures Dean has been paid with coins equal to the value of the purchased item and that her risk towards him has remained invariant. The “risk invariance” property is what her wallet has tried to maintain by redistributing the funds in this particular manner – always making sure she’s not exposed to more risk than before.Eventually all goes well and the pepper reaches Alice. Through her wallet, she marks the purchase as successful.This lets the system replenish the reduced trust to Bob and Charlie, setting the entrusted coins to 24 mBTC and 36 mBTC respectively once again by moving funds from Alice’s exclusive account into the shared accounts. Alice now exclusively owns 34 mBTC. Thus, she can now use a total of 94 mBTC, which is expected, since she had to pay 6 mBTC for the pepper.Sybil resilienceThe careful reader will have noticed that this system is no longer Sybil-attackable. This stems directly from the fact that indirect trust is projected and is based on risk.What this means in short is that if I am a prospective buyer and have a certain amount of indirect trust (or risk) towards a certain group of malicious vendors, there is no way they can cooperate to increase the total trust I see towards them. Regardless of how many fake trust connections they make between each other and towards others and regardless of how many new fake accounts they create, the trust I will have towards them will be the same and bounded by a specific value.To see why, think about how it works in a simple situation with just a single step. Each trust transaction creates a limited liability. If Alice directly trusts Bob with 1 coin, there’s no way he can increase that by trusting others or creating fake accounts. He can’t create a fake shop that Alice trusts more than 1 coin, unless he solicits others to really trust the new shop more. It doesn’t matter how many good transactions he makes with himself using his fake buyers and sellers. It doesn’t even matter how many lines-of-credit he extends to himself. Adding more accounts and trust transactions himself will do him no good. We formalize precisely what this means and prove this fact in our sybil resilience theorem. Intuitively, the only way to increase Alice’s trust towards him is to persuade people Alice trusts (or Alice herself) that he is trustworthy. He can achieve this for example by building a valid and dependable business.ConclusionThis concludes the two pillars of security in our system: On the one hand, we give the user risk invariance, the insurance that they’re not exposed to any more risk than they were willingly exposing themselves to. On the other hand, we give the whole system sybil resilience, meaning there’s no benefit in creating fake accounts.To summarize, we have proposed a new form of bitcoin wallet where people use shared accounts to take calculated risk towards their friends. This augments the OpenBazaar user interface with showing an “allowance” amount calculated behind the scenes using trust flow algorithms. If the user respects our recommendations, they incur no additional risk from making a purchase. For the completion of a purchase, the wallet automatically redistributes the funds in the Trust Is Risk wallet. The user can always replenish their wallet by putting in more money. The system remains resilient to Sybil attacks.We hope one day a system like this can be made part of OpenBazaar and used by people worldwide to make safer trades in a decentralized manner without having to worry about their money being lost or stolen.More resources and acknowledgementsWe’ve been working on these concepts for quite a long time now. These results have been developed at the Decrypto Lab, a loosely connected decentralized lab which bridges the Crypto.Sec group at the University of Athens, the Blockchain Technology Lab at the University of Edinburgh, the Department of Computing at Imperial College London,Corelab at the National Technical University of Athens and other schools and laboratories with interest in the subject.A lot of work remains. The question of whether these security properties can be achieved without disclosing the whole trust graph to everyone is a burning open research challenge. A formal game theoretic analysis of the system would also be a much appreciated addition.This is collaborative work with my colleagues:  Orfeas Stefanos Thyfronitis Litos, currently a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh worked on Trust Is Risk for completing his master thesis at the National Technical University of Athens. You can read his whole thesis[PDF] (of more than 70 pages), which goes in a lot of depth about all the theoretical material I presented here. He worked on most of the formalisms of the proofs and he developed all the trust redistribution algorithms. He also has a presentation of his thesis [ODP].  Christos Porios, currently a Software Engineer at Google Zurich worked on an implementation of Trust Is Risk as his Bachelor thesis for his graduation from Imperial College London. His whole thesis [PDF] (of 50 pages) is on the implementation of Trust is Risk and contains all the little details of how to get it done on top of Bitcoin. He also has a presentation of his thesis [PDF].I was greatly honored to work with both of them.I’m Dionysis Zindros, currently a cryptography/blockchains PhD student at the University of Athens and one of the original OpenBazaar co-founders.Don’t take my word for all our claims and theorems. You can read all the formal math and proofs in our paper, Trust is Risk: A Decentralized Financial Trust Platform [PDF]. We also have a more concise proceedings version [PDF]. The paper was peer-reviewed and published in the Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2017 conference in Malta. The slides of our presentation are also available. We work in an open research setting. All our new experimental attempts at extending our theory are available on our theory GitHub repository where you can participate.We have started working on a first version of a node.js implementation in our implementation GitHub repository, although most of the code is currently in pull requests. We’re also actively working on an SPV implementation.All of this work was made possible through some very generous financing of our research by our partners, OB1 (the OpenBazaar company) and FrostWire – both have provided continuous support both financially but also technically. The whole team has inspired us with their work towards making trade free. Brian Hoffman‘s, Sam Patterson‘s and Angel Leon‘s valuable input has helped us focus our research on applied topics that can be used in the real world to solve real problems. And of course our work is based on the great ideas by Washington Sanchez without whom this project wouldn’t have been born. We’re honoured to have Aggelos Kiayias as our PhD advisor, who has always encouraged us to become better scientists by understanding the problem and all the formal details behind it. Finally, this work was also made possible with the generous financing by IOHK and ERC.",

                "title": "Why We Need Alternatives to Ecommerce Giants Like Amazon", 
                "content": "Amazon has seen incredible growth since its founding in 1994. Originally focused on books, the online marketplace is now the largest retailer in the US, and the fourth most valuable public company in the world. With its recent acquisition of Whole Foods, it becomes even more valuable.Shopping with Amazon is quick and convenient, so much so that it’s starting to become the default method of shopping for many people, just as Google became the default method to search the internet. And just like Google, Amazon collects a staggering amount of information about everyone that uses their platform.Unfortunately, if Amazon (or any retailer) gains the status of default shopping method for a majority of people, they then have an enormous potential to abuse their power. While it’s possible that they might be responsible stewards of their power, there should always be alternatives to using Amazon that protect a user’s privacy and place commerce transactions outside of Amazon’s control.What could Amazon do?It might not be readily apparent how a large retailer could abuse their power, but consider how much information about buyers and sellers Amazon collects, taken directly from their site:  Name  Address  Phone number(s)  Email Address  Credit card(s) information  People to whom purchases have been shipped, including addresses and phone number  E-mail addresses of your friends and other people  Content of reviews and e-mails to Amazon  Personal description and photograph in Amazon Profile  Financial information, including Social Security and driver’s license numbers  Location while using Kindle or other Amazon apps  Searches and browsing while on Amazon  Purchases and sales of products  Your voice if using Alexa or other voice servicesThat’s only the information that you voluntarily give them. They also collect information automatically when you visit the site:  Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection information such as browser type, version, and time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and platform; purchase history, which we sometimes aggregate with similar information from other customers to create features like Top Sellers ; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site, including date and time; cookie number; products you viewed or searched for; and the phone number you used to call our 800 number. We may also use browser data such as cookies, Flash cookies (also known as Flash Local Shared Objects), or similar data on certain parts of our Web site for fraud prevention and other purposes. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page. We may also collect technical information to help us identify your device for fraud prevention and diagnostic purposes.If you use Amazon, they know who you are, where you live, what you buy or sell, even what you want to buy or sell. They know your payment information and history, they know your friends and family, they know details about your web browsers, computers, mobile devices.At any given moment this is a lot of information, but when tracked over years it becomes a detailed look into an individual’s life. With this much data, inferences can be made about nearly every facet of someone’s life.The most innocuous thing Amazon could do with this information is to lose control of it. Breaches of company databases are constantly occurring. With the sheer amount of user information, Amazon’s servers are a highly valuable target for any malicious party.If you trust Amazon to keep your data secure from unauthorized access, then you still be to be concerned about who they authorize to access your information. If Amazon becomes the default shopping method for most people, then it becomes the ultimate tool for oppressive governments to conduct surveillance and control commerce. Amazon already censors their marketplace heavily, and there’s nothing preventing Amazon from reporting users who attempt to sell or search for items that are prohibited by the authorities in various jurisdictions.If Amazon were willing to share their data with governments – or compelled to do so – those authorities could abuse that information in numerous ways. They could cross-reference the sales figures of a store with tax filings to enforce tax compliance. They could access user location information to track individuals. They could look at purchases and search history – particularly their media consumption – to determine someone’s ideological or political affiliations.**What Amazon Has Done**There are many ways Amazon could abuse their power, but not all of them are theoretical. Amazon has taken advantage of their ecommerce giant status in the past.  In 2009, Amazon deleted copies of 1984 and Animal Farm from user’s devices without their permission.  In 2010, Amazon kicked Wikileaks off of its servers following political pressure from the US government.  Various Amazon users have had their accounts closed, and gift card balances taken, without any clarification from Amazon itself.  Amazon has continually been under fire for how it treats its own employees.  A 2016 investigation from ProPublica showed that Amazon’s search promoted their own products over competitors – even when competitors were higher ranked and cheaper.This year, Amazon handed over the Alexa voice recordings of a suspect undergoing an investigation to Arkansas prosecutors (to their credit, Amazon fought this in court first).This is what’s known about how Amazon behaves, but we don’t know how they behave outside the public’s eye. We can only speculate how they will behave in the future.We Need Private Alternatives to Amazon It’s possible that if Amazon becomes too onerous that people would switch platforms to another company that was more friendly to their users. However, switching to another platform controlled by any company or organization is no guarantee that the new platform would be any better long term.Is there any way to really break out of this cycle?Yes. Now, instead of just hoping that Amazon (or another company) will respect its users’ privacy and not abuse their power, users can exchange goods online in an environment free from centralized companies entirely.How is it possible to transact online with no company at the center, controlling it?Removing the middleman entirely from the picture is the only way to ensure that no one is even capable of gaining a position of power over others in an open marketplace. A decentralized marketplace, such as OpenBazaar, doesn’t have any company or organization that collects and stores users’ data or censors their trade. It works because of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which are also decentralized and don’t require third parties to facilitate the exchange, and because of the power of our own personal computers.In this new environment people’s information and transactions are secure and users are the ones who are in control; they trade directly with each other and don’t need to trust any company or organization with their data.It’s important to have choices in what you are going to buy as well as the networks you are going to use. We have built a marketplace that aligns with our core values of giving choices to individuals who want to control more of their information online.If you’re looking for a new way to buy and sell goods online that is completely different than anything you’ve seen before, check out OpenBazaar.",

                "title": "First Look: Super Fast Checkout Process In OpenBazaar 2.0", 
                "content": "Yesterday our designer, Mike Wolf, shared this great tweet about the speed of the purchasing time within OpenBazaar 2.0:We want to be clear that this is an example of how fast it can be to get through the checkout process within the application, not the time it takes the transaction to clear on Bitcoin. That will still be dependent on the bitcoin network itself.Why is the checkout process this fast, now?  Because of the internal wallet!In the current version of OpenBazaar there is no built-in wallet so users need to use a wallet external to the app in order to make purchases. This gif shows the new process for OpenBazaar 2.0, launching soon, which has a wallet built into the application. Instead of being forced to use an external wallet, you will be able to pay bitcoin into the OpenBazaar wallet–where you still control your own keys locally–and then make payments as shown in the gif.This new wallet is an SPV wallet where each user owns their own keys. Users will have this wallet by default though they can swap it out for bitcoind if they prefer. The wallet talks directly to the Bitcoin network, meaning all transactions are on-chain and there are no servers.Okay…but what’s an SPV wallet? The most secure way to use Bitcoin is to run a “full node” which means you have the entire copy of the blockchain and you verify all new transactions in new blocks yourself. However, running a full node is inconvenient, requiring a significant amount of disk space and other resources. The average user isn’t going to download the entire blockchain.  That’s where Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) wallets come in.The basic idea is that an SPV wallet doesn’t verify everything in blocks as accurate, so it doesn’t need to download the entire chain. It relies on a trusted node for verification.We’re very excited about this new internal wallet because it offers a greater level of convenience and access to users that is reflected in this checkout time.  The whole purchasing flow is smooth and we cannot wait to get OpenBazaar 2.0 into users hands this summer.Are you ready to check it out?Sign up for our newsletter here for opportunities to be one of the first users of version 2.0Join us on Slack, Twitter or FacebookAnd of course, you can still download OpenBazaar v.1 to shop right now!",

            "blog-why-is-decentralization-important": { 
                "title": "Why Is Decentralization Important?", 
                "content": "In a recent post we talked about how “decentralization is guiding the ship.” While the definition of the word can be guessed easily enough, the concept is nuanced and takes some time to understand the costs and benefits of decentralization.Decentralization is a concept in politics, business, technology, and other fields. In a nutshell, it means a central authority doesn’t have control over a system, but control is distributed among the participants in the system. For example:  A centralized political system has a central authority with most (or all) of the power. In a decentralized political system the power rests closer to the individual or their representatives.  A centralized business structure has a central authority with most (or all) the power. In a decentralized business structure the power to make decisions is distributed between individuals and teams.  There are costs and benefits to these approaches in political and business settings.The centralized approach allows for more rapid and decisive decision-making, as well as giving participants in the system a sense of clarity about the rules and their own role within it. It also sets up a structure to enforce those rules.Unfortunately, this also highlights one of the primary drawbacks of centralized systems: what if the central authority acts in ways that are harmful to the participants in the system? There are innumerable examples of tyrannical governments abusing their power. There are also many examples of the leadership teams of companies making poor decisions and refusing to delegate power such that their decisions destroyed the company.Decentralization avoids the abuse of power from central authorities. However, this comes at the cost of every participant taking on some responsibility themselves.When we speak about OpenBazaar being decentralized, we are specifically referring to the architecture of the network itself. There is no central point of control in OpenBazaar, unlike Amazon or eBay. All participants in the network have equal power and can’t be forced by anyone else to do anything. This is radically different from the standard centralized model of ecommerce, and it has both costs and benefits.  Making trade free is the purpose of OpenBazaar. Decentralization is the method OpenBazaar uses to make trade free.Beyond just being able to use cryptocurrencies easily, decentralization is what allows for all of the other benefits of the marketplace, such as:  There are no fees to use the platform  There is no central authority collecting data  There is no central authority able to take down a store or force a user to follow their terms and conditions  Users have total control of all of their tradeCentralized marketplaces can’t offer these guarantees because their revenue models require that they do things to impose on users in one or all of these areas.  If they didn’t charge fees, they’d need to monetize with user data  If they didn’t want to monetize user data, they’d need to charge fees  If they didn’t censor transactions and take down stores, they’d be forced to do so by governments (or be shut down themselves)There’s really no possible way to run a permissionless marketplace unless it’s based on decentralized architecture.On the internet, everything you see is based on files that “live” on a server somewhere. A server is just a name for another computer. Most servers are owned (or rented) by the central authority than runs the website you’re visiting, usually a company. When you use Amazon for shopping, you are connecting to Amazon’s servers, just like everyone else using Amazon. This is a centralized system. The decentralized system – like OpenBazaar – means computers aren’t connecting to a central location. They connect directly to each other. Basically, each user becomes their own server. This is one of the costs of using a decentralized system. Each participant in a decentralized system takes on some of the power that the centralized authority would normally have, which leads to the benefits mentioned above. It also means that they will have to take extra steps they wouldn’t need to take in a centralized system. In a decentralized political or business structure, this might mean people are forced to direct themselves instead of just taking orders. Their success or failure is then dependent on their own actions instead of the decisions of the central authority.In a decentralized network, it means the participants need to be running the program themselves on their computer instead of relying on the central authority to do that for them. In OpenBazaar version 1.0, this meant users would need to run the software 24/7 in order to engage in trade with other people on the network. In the upcoming version 2.0, we have built on IPFS, allowing stores to go offline and still be available to other users if their store has been seeded. Even though this reduces the costs for users to access OpenBazaar, it’s still not as convenient as using the centralized ecommerce options.  Every user must weigh the costs and benefits of the different systems and determine which they prefer.Centralized systems are abundant and widely used for ecommerce today. A usable decentralized ecommerce system didn’t exist until OpenBazaar, and for those that prefer it, we welcome them.Are you ready to check it out?Download OpenBazaarJoin us on Slack, Twitter or Facebook",

            "blog-why-openbazaar-token-doesn-t-exist": { 
                "title": "Why OpenBazaar Token Doesn’t Exist", 
                "content": "If you’re even remotely interested in the world of cryptocurrencies, then you’re aware of a relatively recent phenomenon called ICOs (also called token sales). These ICOs happen when developers of a project announce their intention to create a new coin / token and then allow the public to purchase it. Recent ICOs have been making headlines for raising tens of millions of dollars in only hours or even minutes.Many projects that focus on building the infrastructure for a decentralized internet have launched, or are launching, their own tokens. IPFS will use Filecoin. Blockstack announced they will use a token. Storj recently had an ICO. All these projects claim to need a new token in order for their products to function properly.  OpenBazaar is also focused on building a decentralized application, so why is there no OpenBazaar Token?There are multiple reasons why we haven’t issued a token and this post is meant to explain them. These reasons aren’t necessarily set in stone; we are continually re-evaluating whether or not a token makes sense given the rapidly changing cryptocurrency landscape.1. OpenBazaar Doesn’t Need a Token to WorkThe first reason is the most compelling: We don’t need a token in order for OpenBazaar to work as intended in its current design.OpenBazaar is a protocol and network for decentralized trade. People download software to their own computer or mobile phone and directly connect with other people running the same software, and they then engage in trade without any middleman involved. The OpenBazaar network has existed since April 2016 with hundreds of thousands of downloads and users in countries all over the world engaging in trade with each other using Bitcoin.  It’s not immediately clear how an OpenBazaar Token improves on this process.It’s true that Bitcoin fees are very high right now, which causes problems for a marketplace built on Bitcoin. We hope that fees will return to a reasonable level in the near future, but if not then the solution is to allow users to pay in other widely-used cryptocurrencies, not create a new one.It’s possible that there might be a unique way a token could provide utility to OpenBazaar users even though it’s not necessary for the core functionality of the application. We welcome such ideas, but haven’t yet heard any compelling ones.2. Tokens are a New and Unproven ModelWith ICOs and token sales quickly garnering huge attention – and investment – it’s easy to forget that they are a relatively new phenomenon. This is particularly true for token sales on Ethereum.It’s clear that they are able to gain interest from investors, but that’s where the clarity ends. There are many areas of uncertainty about how these projects will manage and utilize these tokens moving forward, and how the token holders will behave as well.I’m sure that some – perhaps many – investors in these tokens are true believers in the underlying projects themselves. However, it’s obvious that a substantial proportion of investors are speculating on the tokens. During a period of “good times” the speculation on the tokens benefits the token creators, and right now it seems hard to argue against the massive raises these projects have accumulated.  Anyone who has been involved in the cryptocurrency market – or any financial market – knows that the “good times” don’t last forever.When speculators choose to take their gains from a token and cash out, there needs to be a buyer available. If there is genuine demand for the underlying project and people want the token in order to use the network, then there’s no problem. However, if most of the demand has come from speculators instead, then at some point there will be no further speculators available, and there is the risk of token holders attempting to exit en masse, rapidly driving the price of the token down.The ever-present threat of people selling their tokens could be considered a positive pressure on the project developers to deliver on their promises. Unfortunately it’s not always clear that the incentives of the project leaders and those of the token speculators are always aligned. Speculators may act similarly to public shareholders in companies, pressuring the executives in the company to make decisions based on short-term profits instead of what is best for the company long-term.Since OpenBazaar started in 2014, we’ve had an engaged community of people all over the world who believe in decentralization and free trade. We’re certain that issuing an OpenBazaar Token would increase the size of those interested in the project, but we fear that it would also change the composition of the community from people who agree with our core ideals to a group of people who want to see a return on their investment. We don’t want to make decisions based on what would be best for the price of our token, but instead focus on how we can make trade free for the world.3. A Token could Increase the Barriers to EntryOpenBazaar is all about lowering the barriers to trade for everyone. All you need is an internet connection, a computer, and Bitcoin to engage in trade with anyone else in the world, at no cost.  Introducing a token could increase the barriers to entry into the OpenBazaar ecosystem.We want permissionless, frictionless trade to always be possible on our network. OpenBazaar currently relies on the most widely used cryptocurrency in existence – Bitcoin – and we are building the 2.0 version of the software so users can choose to use other popular cryptocurrencies as well.The on-ramps into Bitcoin are well-established, as are the wallets to store and spend them. This isn’t true for new coins and tokens. Only knowledgeable cryptocurrency users are able to purchase these tokens and use them. Forcing users into a new token ecosystem reduces the possible number of people the platform can reach.As mentioned in #1, it’s possible to issue a token that isn’t necessary to use the network, but thus far we haven’t heard any compelling ideas.4. Tokens Sales are a Regulatory Unknown  There is still significant uncertainty how governments will regulate ICOs / token sales.If they choose to take a lax approach, the token creators may have little to fear. But if they choose to apply strict regulations instead, the regulatory compliance costs could soon become unbearable, especially if the technology itself needed to change in order to fully comply.Also, scrutiny from agencies doesn’t only apply to token sales moving forward, but can apply to sales that have already occurred. This creates a situation where there is a “Sword of Damocles” hanging over these projects until regulatory guidance is issued.Not all token creators are just crossing their fingers and hoping for the best. The Protocol Labs team joined with AngelList to launch CoinList, a platform to launch tokens which attempts to comply with know-your-customer (KYC) regulations and generally assure the tokens are issued in a manner compliant with relevant rules. This may work well for some tokens, but compliance comes at the cost of exclusivity. Only accredited investors have access to the initial sale, creating huge barriers to entry. Accredited investors are more likely to be interested in speculation than using the tokens, emphasizing the potential problems raised in #2 above.Conditions for Token IssuanceIt’s possible that an OpenBazaar Token may be issued at some point, but it would only happen if the following conditions were met:  A new token is needed to provide utility to OpenBazaar users that cannot be provided by Bitcoin or any existing token.  The token sale would be an opportunity to distribute tokens to users of OpenBazaar who believe in decentralization and free trade and are not solely focused on speculation.  The token would not increase the barriers to entry into the OpenBazaar network.  If government agencies issued strict regulatory guidelines it wouldn’t significantly disrupt the OpenBazaar ecosystem due to a reliance on the token.These conditions may or may not be able to ever be satisfied but OpenBazaar is open-source and we love to hear feedback on our ideas.

Just as the value is regularly breaking records now the debates are hotter than ever over the future of this blockchain that spawned a thousand blockchains.No doubt Bitcoin is an important development in technology–some would say as important as the internet itself. Many also liken the energy around it to the time when the internet was developing for users and forward-thinkers knew it would be big, but not yet what all it could actually do. Now we can see the tools it birthed such as email and mobile and today we can see the impact those things have had.We know enough about it now to know that it’s a pretty big deal but the questions of why, how and for whom still hang in our digital air.How is a company who wants to build applications that use Bitcoin supposed to keep up?Bitcoin is still king in this space but it is just the beginning of a huge new way of connecting, creating and sharing value online. It represents, we believe, the advent of a new internet. And that vision sparks technology which, in turn, sparks more vision.Or as, allegedly, Marshall McLuhan stated in 1967:  “We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us.”The initial vision for Bitcoin was simply a peer-to-peer digital currency that would allow people to exchange payments without middlemen. Now it’s spawned many offshoots that are basically ideological playgrounds for what this sort of public ledger technology can really do. Each of these now are like puzzle pieces, microorganisms that are co-evolving in technology much like they do in nature.We have experienced this personally with OpenBazaar where a new file storage protocol that didn’t materially exist just 3 years ago emerged with incredible implications for the protocol that we had built around that time. The choice to build version 2.0 on IPFS was pretty easy as it was an exact piece that was missing from our own puzzle. But it wasn’t shoved in the couch cushions, it simply didn’t exist yet. And that is awesome. It resulted in a lot of new work but we didn’t begrudge it. We transitioned with excitement and anticipation because we know why we’re doing what we’re doing.We keep up by focusing on the bigger picture.OpenBazaar is a marketplace that makes it easy for users to exchange goods and services for a cryptocurrency. And as the name itself implies, we believe in cryptocurrencies that can be used as a currency, a medium of everyday types of purchases.We believe this because we want to live in a world with fewer barriers. We want to see a world where people can build what they want and where beautiful things happen when their work and tools overlap and complement one another. We believe in people making choices for themselves and taking ownership and control of what they do.From code to lifestyle, we want to create tools that provide access, tools that allow everyone to figure out the kind of life they’d like to build, from wherever they are in the world.Right now the path we need is paved with Bitcoin, which we love continue to champion, but it’s really about the vision of what Bitcoin represents–not the specific technology. Bitcoin may fail, but decentralization is guiding the ship for us.  We believe in faster, cheaper, better technology that connects more people with fewer barriers.The only way through is through. That means boots-on-the-ground, roll-up-the-sleeves through. If you’re curious what the future looks like, then build it with us.**A free marketplace. No fees. No restrictions.

                "content": "Wow, what a wild week it has been! Between attending the blockchain industry’s biggest event and the skyrocketing prices of just about every cryptocurrency — especially Bitcoin — capped with a holiday weekend, we are still reeling. We are all back at our desks though and finally had a chance to unpack some of our thoughts about CoinDesk’s annual event, Consensus, in beautiful New York City!10,000 Foot ViewFirst, the event was huge. Tickets were sold out and almost 3,000 people were in attendance across 4-5 floors. Speakers &amp; panels were often down to standing room only and some great topics were covered like Can Bitcoin Scale? and Chasing Privacy in Blockchains among many other discussions &amp; presentations on the business &amp; technical applications of blockchain.Second, you couldn’t help but realize that cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin are gaining fast in their validity and tokens/Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) may still be controversial, but they are big business at the moment with a lot of money to show for it. Everyone was interested in learning about ICO case studies and their future as a serious business model beneath the looming cloud of regulation.Third, it seems that Bitcoin still has some battles ahead of it still as miners, developers and users continue to wrestle with the best way to scale it. Fundamentally it will come down to the question of defining what BTC really is—a currency or a security — either by declaration or action.We have our own thoughts about this and were also excited to soft launch a new campaign we are working on as the OB1 team to share them. Check out Crypto Is Currency Day coming up this September and join us if you believe in the mission of digital currencies we can actually acquire &amp; spend easily &amp; efficiently.Getting PersonalTo conclude, we also wanted to share few other exciting thing that were shared by some of our excellent partners at the event!Prism is a new service from Shapeshift that uses Ethereum to allow users to invest in a basket of cryptocurrencies of their choosing. In their words, “Prism is a platform upon which humans and machines can acquire exposure to portfolios of digital assets without trusting a counterparty.” We think non-custodian exchanges like this is a big step in the right direction to protect users and provide more privacy and security to traders. More details hereProtocol Labs, the company behind IPFS, teamed up with AngelList to create a new platform for token sales, called CoinList. We’re interested to see more of their work here which is aiming to legitimize crowdfunding crypto projects through ICOs within the United States and providing opportunities for them to stay here instead of moving offshore. More details hereNext, we are proud to announce our newest partnership with Digital Currency Group (DCG) as a strategic investor! This is very exciting for us as DCG is the most active investor and business incubator in the bitcoin and blockchain industry and they share a vision for the future of commerce where digital currencies are more accessible and usable for everyone. See our press release for more information.Finally, for more of our thoughts on the event, check out this brief YouTube Live video we recorded this week with another partner of ours, Jeremy, CEO of Never Stop Marketing.We are really energized by the members of our community who are working hard to build the financial future they want to see and we are privileged to be working with them.

Achieving this mission will only happen if we’re adaptable and willing to honestly assess whether or not the technologies we use are helping us to fulfill our mission, or holding us back.For payment technology, OpenBazaar currently uses Bitcoin for transactions within the marketplace. Bitcoin is the most recognized, most secure, and most used cryptocurrency available today. It allows OpenBazaar to exist without the need to rely on third parties. There are many other cryptocurrencies available as well but the OpenBazaar protocol and software is being built by a small group of individuals and we have chosen to keep our scope reasonable by focusing purely on Bitcoin.  However, for various reasons, we do believe OpenBazaar should be able to support multiple types of payment methods.It’s possible that Bitcoin may not always be the king of cryptocurrencies. Other cryptocurrencies may surpass it, or they might be more suited for the types of transactions that OpenBazaar users need.There is a considerable amount of excitement from other coin communities to support their projects through OpenBazaar. We’re optimistic about what they have to offer as we think decentralized payment choices should be diverse and ultimately in the hands of users.We will do everything we can to support the flexibility needed to enable this functionality in a way that doesn’t sacrifice any of the core tenets of our project. This includes additional documentation on how other currencies can be integrated by coin developers. We will continue to have discussions with the community on how best to create a strong user experience with multiple wallets and coins.Want to get more involved?If you are interested in what the development process of integrating your favorite coin into the OpenBazaar network would involve, click here for more information: github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-go/blob/master/docs/altcoins.mdIf you’re interested in staying up to date with new developments related to altcoin integrations, please email our Community Manager, Jenn Cloud, at jenn[at]ob1.io and for general updates related to OpenBazaar please subscribe to the OB1 newsletter at ob1.io",

I work in a branch of BMW Group in Munich and use OpenBazaar to promote the brand as well.How familiar are you with Bitcoin?I believe Bitcoin is the invention of our generation and is the next big thing after the Internet.I am not a tech guy so I don’t have much to say about development but I do support this technology as much as I can. I use it as payment when possible, just some small transactions in order to show my support, and I use to trade it against some alts in an exchange. I am not very familiar with trading so I don’t do this much, though.Most of all, I am person who doesn’t support the power of governments and banks over people so any chance I have in life to disrupt the System I embrace with love  Peer 2 Peer trading and for sure Bitcoin are two things that allow me to do this in a practical way.How did you find out about OpenBazaar?I first read about it on Twitter and thought I’d give a shot!Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar?I use Bitcoin in my daily life, I am a fan of BMW, and I support the anti-bank and agorism movements. Those 3 things combine perfectly in OpenBazaar!How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far?I don’t earn anything for myself by selling the BMW items that I do in OpenBazaar, I just do it for the pleasure of promoting the brand and promoting the use of Bitcoin.

                "title": "The Dangers of —and Fix for —\"Fake Markets\"", 
                "content": "The Internet facilitates an astounding (and ever-increasing) amount of commerce in our world. Allowing people to communicate with each other anywhere in the world and at low cost has ushered in an new era of global trade.  However, a few powerful organizations wield great influence over commerce online, and they have used their power to set up a rigged game. A “fake market.”Anil Dash recently wrote an article entitled “Tech and the Fake Market tactic” which gives examples of how a few companies have creating markets online that appear fair, but in reality are tilted in their own favor:  Google’s results showing Google products first  Amazon displays it’s own products over better alternatives  Uber drivers’ rates aren’t decided by the drivers but set by UberThese companies aren’t doing anything you wouldn’t expect them to do — they are using their popularity to give themselves a further advantage. But as these companies’ share of online commerce grows, their ability to further manipulate the markets in their favor grows as well. It’s not hard to imagine how Google, Amazon, or other huge companies on the Internet could further their positions as “default” services by manipulating what their users see for their own benefit.These companies also collect the data of all their users for their own purposes, charge fees when users sell on their platforms, and censor trade based on their own interests or on behalf of governments. They act as gatekeepers into their own tightly-controlled system. Most users aren’t aware they are seeing a rigged market, and even if they do realize it they aren’t aware of any alternatives.What can be done about these rigged markets? In his article Anil suggests the following course of action:  Perhaps the single most effective action we can take is to educate our elected officials about the changes that are happening.I disagree with Anil that elected officials are the right people to solve this problem. Their only tool is the application of law, which is a powerful but blunt instrument. Politicians don’t have a compelling track record when it comes to understanding new technologies. Regulators are often strongly influenced by the people they are regulating — a term called “regulatory capture” — and these powerful companies would try to help make the new rules end up in their favor.  There’s a more compelling way to address rigged markets: bypass the gatekeepers of online commerce altogether.Their power comes from the centralized nature of the existing commerce platforms. They control the center; they control the commerce.Fortunately, a handful of emerging technologies gives us the ability to fix these rigged markets once and for all. But new markets are emerging that have no center to control. They are decentralized, meaning each user in these markets connects directly to other users. These markets have no gatekeepers; there are no gates to keep in a completely peer-to-peer marketplace. Decentralized markets also have no fees, no data collection, and no censorship.They can’t be rigged.It’s not possible to have a truly open and transparent marketplace when one party controls the entire market. But online markets can be fair and free. Not because some elected officials may demand it, but because decentralization creates a level playing field where no one has an advantage over anyone else.Decentralized tools such as OpenBazaar and Bitcoin are already being used as an alternative to the dominant online commerce platforms and payment methods. If you want to participate in online commerce that is fair and free, trying using them today.**Ready to fight back against fake markets?**Download OpenBazaar now!",

                "content": " OpenBazaar Front End Lead Josh Jeffryes describes the evolution of OB1’s collaboration process for our entirely remote team building the decentralized marketplace, OpenBazaar:The OB1 ProcessBuilding great products requires a great process. As the OpenBazaar platform has grown, so has the way we work together to build it. We’ve continuously improved how we plan and execute our work, and as we near the release of version 2 of OpenBazaar, we’d like to share some insight into those improvements with you.The Minimal Viable ProcessOpenBazaar started as a side project, and at the start we had a side project process. We used Slack and Github, and kept things informal. As we grew into a full-time startup, with a fully remote team distributed across the world, we needed a startup process.When your idea and team are small, a minimal process is ok. The idea fits in everyone’s minds, and you agree on what it is. But as the idea grows, it stops fitting, and the parts in each mind may not match. You need an external map so those parts still fit together when you’re done.Introducing AgileWithout a process to create that map, you spend most of your time maintaining agreement about what you’re building, instead of building it.This is where Agile was a critical tool for us. We constructed a process from Agile patterns, and added or removed patterns as we went.We began by defining each feature needed for OpenBazaar version 2. Then we organized those features into sprints of 2 weeks each. This makes it possible to know if a UI feature will be built in sprint 6, the back end functionality needs to be built in spring 5, the design in sprint 4, and the specifications in sprint 3. Technical details were fleshed out in regular planning sessions before each sprint.Trello was our tool for sprint organization. It’s simple and easy to use. Github was used to track issues, bugs, and technical specifications, and designs were shared with Zeplin.More Collaboration Means Less Everything ElseIf you don’t use the same map, you don’t arrive at the same place. We stay on the map by constantly building it together.Before any feature is worked on, we work together to define it over video conferencing, first as a user story (“the user wants to do “x”), then a design, and finally a detailed set of technical requirements.When a feature is done, the code is reviewed by the whole team. A lead reviewer gives detailed feedback, but other members, even non-technical ones, comments on what the feature does and how it works.Always ImprovingWe continue to improve and change our process. We’ve added back in some Agile patterns we discarded previously as too structured. When our sprints became more formal, with set planning, review, and retrospectives, Trello started to strain under the level of detail we needed. We moved to Jira, which allowed us to set up a customized process.The OpenBazaar platform becomes stronger every day because we constantly iterate, test, and improve it. Like every great startup, we treat our process the same way.ICYMIIn case you missed it, here is other notable news from the last couple of weeks:OpenBazaar project “Bazaar Loans” wins second place in Distributed: Markets Blockchain HackathonAre you a developer who wants to get involved in this early stage?Get the details here!Want to start RIGHT NOW buying and selling with Bitcoin using version 1.0?Download OpenBazaar now!",

I have made a few purchases on OB and I just love the fact I can order something from someone across the globe, the money goes DIRECTLY to them, and I can experience things that I normally wouldn’t be able to.For example, I ordered some Riceberry from Thailand. If I were to order this on Amazon it would cost me $35-50 depending on the source and I would likely still pay for shipping since most of them are not prime. On OpenBazaar I was able to get a brick of it, along with some extra swag the buyer threw in, for only $30–and that INCLUDED the shipping. Cutting out the middleman apparently saves money, who knew! Now I am able to experience a strain of rice and some culture from across the globe, from the comfort of my own home, all while helping someone who has the foresight to try to be an entrepreneur in this global marketplace.So far the community has been very welcoming. I even had 1 purchase on one of my earlier stores before my history got erased because I didn’t yet know how to backup the GUID/STORE from my VPS (Virtual Private Server). I had one purchase later and was hoping/waiting on some feedback but it never came through. Thankfully I was able to use a moderator to get the funds moved from escrow to my wallet.  I’m grateful for the testing and experience I’ve gained using the platform at an early stage.This will allow me to appreciate the more streamlined clients to come. I still am a relative OpenBazaar newb as I have only been in the community for about a month now.Even if it doesn’t work out to where I can use this as a source of income, I’ve learned some networking/computing skills I didn’t have before. I hopefully can inspire a few people to go down the same route as me with their artwork and this can have a pay it forward mentality. I look forward to watching OpenBazaar and its community grow as bitcoin becomes more globally adopted and hopefully we can start a Digital Media Revolution!Why did you start in this business?For a stock image/video/art buyer, trying to use the current system of using the big name sites like Shutterstock can be a pain. There are various licensing options depending how the buyer wants to use the photo. Is it a one time use? Is it in a magazine? If so how big is their distribution? Do they want exclusive rights?There are difficulties for creators as well. You have to apply to sell by submitting some work and having them judge the photo before selling. This is to create more quality images to sell the marketplace’s brand at a higher price than competitors. These websites also take a cut of the money from the photographer for offering this service and it just creates extra paperwork/red-tape.Then there’s the internet itself. It is a great engine for sharing and reposting content and great communities try to give the original video/author credit, but does it work all the time or endure for the whole lifespan of the image? Can people take my creations and profit somewhere that I may never see a penny of it? Most definitely, but by applying the wisdom of crowds and hoping that by eliminating red-tape and licensing options with a buy-it-once approach I can spend more time doing what I want–which is taking photos/making images–and sell more images for less rather than just a few images for more than what they are worth.The idea I have is to be able to sell your digital goods with an open source mindset, thus calling my store “Open Source Photos.” This means that creators can sell their work through their their own store by using a service like ascribe.io to claim ownership of the image and if it becomes frequently used or remixed that good fortune will trickle its way back to you.What is ascribe.io? I’m quoting from their website:  “Attribution for your creative work will stay with you forever.”  “Create a permanent and unbreakable link between you and your creative work. That link – the record of ownership – can be forever verified and tracked.”  “Each registered piece comes with a COA, a built in unique cryptographic ID and the complete ownership history. The COA can be verified anytime and printed out.”  “Transfer, consign or loan your digital creations without losing attribution. Our easy-to-use platform comes equipped with clear legal framework and supports custom contracts.”Basically think free, blockchain-based copyright service for artists. This sort of tracking creates a proof that each image a creator uploads is actually their image. Even if someone then buys an image and tries to re-upload it, the original artist’s date stamp will still be prior to theirs so the community can still see the original author. They can let their images go with the “Open Source License” – basically the MIT license but replace code/programs with digital files/images.Copyright is dead – or rather should be drastically changed.The idea behind copyright makes sense in terms of protecting an artists work and trying to get them the money they deserve for their work , however it has gone overboard in my opinion. If you think about it, many creations are created of the backs of another idea. It is hard to come up with an original song without subconsciously using a riff you may have heard. Using code from one program to implement it in another creating a new service that didn’t exist before. Sure there are the truly innovating who can come up with a unique concept, but most things are a remix already.By applying copyright to everything it stifles innovation and creation. Just look at YouTube’s copyright policy which is now banning users and de-monetizing their videos all because of a 3 second sound clip that matched one in their database. Algorithms are now becoming judge, jury and executioner (of profits). What helped the growth of YouTube (the crazy remix videos) is now becoming banned, and I feel in the long term, YouTube is going to be the next MySpace if enough users jump ship to a platform that isn’t so riddled with legal paperwork.What is your target market?By offering my images at a low price it allows that kid who’s 16 who maybe wants some pictures to practice with in Photoshop or web design but he doesn’t have a credit card to purchase images offline and he doesn’t want to steal someone’s work. He can now using just a small amount of bitcoin to purchase a photo and do what he wants with it. I’m not going to track anyone down and demand royalties. Want an easy image for a blog post/forum/website/business header? Buy it once and re-use it remix it as much as you want!If someone living in a real market city in, let’s say India, wants to buy a few of my images to make and sell physical prints on the other side of the world, whyshould I get a percentage of every sale? They did all of the legwork to print this image and bring it to their local market that way. They aren’t saturating my local area with my own work and it won’t affect my profits here. It would be nice to get recondition for my work like with a CC license (this means they can re-mix re-use your work but they legally have to give you credit which again is more red tape) but I do not require it because if it works out and they want more images, they will come back. Also each image using ascribe.io will be date stamped to me being the author of the image.  If someone wants to purchase images and create OpenBazaar themes to then sell on OpenBazaar – please do it! I feel if you change the photo or are using it in a unique way that you thought of, I shouldn’t get any part of that. I simply gave you the blue paint and you used it to paint the ocean.I am hoping others will go with this idea, letting their art go for cheap and allowing it to be remixed and resold, as this could create a feedback loop where the artists are not only making money off consumers and fans of their work, but the majority of their money will be coming from within the community because the money will flow from one artist to the other as they bounce images/ideas/themes/photo skills off each other.How will you determine your prices?I will do my best at keeping the costs as low as possible while still covering transaction cost/listing time. I ideally would like to sell images for around $1-2 a piece. Rather than try to take 1 amazing work and sell it for $1,000, I’d rather have so many images that people want to use because of the convenience that I’m selling 1,000 photos for $1. And because of the integration with cryptocurrency it makes selling for smaller amounts economically feasible.Meet Tim &amp; check out Open Source Photos, coming soon!Want to learn more about vendors and thinkers in the OpenBazaar community?Check out these posts!**Would you like to have a store on OpenBazaar?**Becoming a vendor is easy and completely free!

                "title": "Development Update: Using IPFS for Encrypted Chat", 
                "content": "For the past couple of weeks, OpenBazaar front-end developer Rob Misiorowski has been elbows-deep in the development of the 2.0 chat feature. Here is a look into some of the work he’s been doing:For the past few weeks I’ve been working on the chat function for version 2.0 which is similar to current 1.0 chat, with a few enhancements on the user’s side. Notably planned is emoji support, typing &amp; message read indicators, and an Unread Messages badge indicating offscreen threads with unread messages.There are new things going on under the hood, though. To get certain data needed for the Chat UI (handle, avatar hash, location), individual profiles for each user in the UI need to be obtained. These need to be obtained via IPNS, which has been quite slow (calls often take 10+ seconds). The problem with having to make an individual call for each chat head is that the browser has a limit of 6 concurrent HTTP requests to the same domain. So, if we clog that up with bulky time-consuming IPNS calls, the rest of the app will be blocked. For example, if the user tries to navigate to another page, any data required for that page will go to the end of the HTTP request queue and would need to wait until no more than 5 of the chat IPNS calls are left. That could be a while and in the meantime the user would just be looking at a loading spinner which is a great way to ruin the usability of a feature.What is IPNS?It’s new. Here’s a digest from back-end developer Tyler Smith: IPNS is like DNS for IPFS content. It let’s you find IPFS data by a name if you don’t know the hash. The hashes verify integrity so IPFS only needs to find one copy of the content when you search by hash. But when you search by name it has to talk to many nodes and find a quorum of what hash a name points at which makes it much slower.So what we decided to do was expose an HTTP endpoint on the server where you could request profiles in bulk. For example, if we need 10 profiles, we could request them in 1 call, instead of 10. Furthermore, the endpoint has an ‘async’ option, which if true would send the profiles back via sockets as they are obtained by the server. Long story short, we’re not clogging up the UI and we still get the profiles as they’re available. Hooray!Additional thoughts about IPFS/IPNS from Rob:In our experience, direct IPFS calls have been fairly performant. IPNS calls, on the other hand, have been quite slow. Apparently the bottleneck is that it takes quite a bit of time for the IPFS system to get the mapping of peerId to hash. When we were at Coindesk’s Construct 2017 event a couple of weeks ago we brought this up with the IPFS team and they gave us an idea of how we could improve this performance. It basically involves having the server register in a pub / sub system with other nodes so that as soon as a node has its hash available, it publishes it in real time and any subscribed servers could cache that mapping. That way, the expensive lookup wouldn’t have to happen as the UI is trying to get data. We haven’t looked into implementing that yet and it’s unknown how much of an improvement that would give us, but it does sound quite promising!ICYMIIn case you missed it, here is other notable news from the last couple of weeks:Openbazaar Integrates Tor – The Platform’s Most Requested Feature – news.bitcoin.comAre you a developer who wants to get involved in this early stage?Get the details here!Want to start RIGHT NOW buying and selling with Bitcoin using version 1.0?Download OpenBazaar now and do the thing!",

                "content": "This new year we’ve been looking at new technologies to see how they could improve our lives. The best example (and the inspiration at the root of OpenBazaar) is new money – such as Bitcoin – which lets us exchange value with each other directly. No need to rely on banks or other third parties.Also, new networks, built intentionally to be decentralized, now provide a way for people to take greater control of their online lives.OpenBazaar is one of these new networks. Launched in 2016 it’s being used by people all over the world right now who are buying and selling directly with each other and paying in Bitcoin.Building something as revolutionary as a fully decentralized marketplace has had its challenges and we are so grateful for the feedback we’ve received from our active users. Enacting that feedback has ended up being a bit broader than we expected and to meet the needs of our community so this year OpenBazaar will become a brand new network again when the 2.0 version of the software launches.Why did we decide to do a rebuild rather than an update?It’s been exciting to see how people have used the current version of the software, but a lot has changed since we started working on OpenBazaar in 2014. Other technologies have become more mature and reliable. Due to the feedback from our users we saw how we could utilize these new technologies to make the p2p trade experience even better, and we began building a new version of OpenBazaar.Here are the major points of the 2.0 rebuild:NetworkThis new version of OpenBazaar is being built on top of another very new, decentralized network called the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). Being built on IPFS is exciting for many reasons but the most practical reason is that that OpenBazaar stores and listings will be cached and seeded between each other, meaning that store data will be distributed across the network. A store which is seeded will no longer need to be online 24/7 for their store and listings to be accessible by others on the network. This was a major piece of the puzzle for building a truly decentralized network that was also incredibly functional–even functional enough to compete with existing (and wildly popular) ecommerce models.LanguageThe software is also being rewritten in a new language. Originally in Python, version 2.0 is written in Go to allow for better management of dependencies and for the end user, much easier installation.WalletThe new software will have built-in Bitcoin wallets for users. Acquiring and storing Bitcoin can still be a challenge and we wanted the platform to meet users earlier in the game. We are unable to set up a full exchange to facilitate the buying and selling of Bitcoin but we can help users with storage by building a custom wallet into the app.PrivacyApart from being further decentralized, the new version will also support Tor, giving users more privacy. An ideological pillar we share with many of our users is that people have a right to privacy in their daily lives, a principle that has gotten tangled up a bit since internet use has gone mainstream. We want buyers and sellers to have as much control over their online trade as possible.Want to learn more?Check out this teaser video below put together by by our UX / Design Lead, Mike Wolf and read the full 2.0 background feature here: OpenBazaar 2.0: P2P trade takes the next stepAre you a developer who wants to get involved in this early stage?Get the details here!Just want to get started RIGHT NOW buying and selling with Bitcoin using version 1.0?Download OpenBazaar now!",

This release is meant solely for developers and those building or intending to build on top of the OpenBazaar platform. The release is not meant for end users and is missing numerous core features needed for engaging in real transactions. Before the launch of the full version of the 2.0 software we will have a formal beta with a fully featured release; details of this formal beta will be posted on this blog soon.We define milestone 1 as such:  Beta Users can download and install the client and server from github, and use it to fill in their profile, store info, and post listings. The network can host listings, stores, and user profiles.This is the bare level of functionality needed for developers to use and understand key aspects of the new design in the 2.0 software. Developers can now begin using the software to post and retrieve data from the OpenBazaar / IPFS network, enabling the building of crawlers, search engines, and other tools.InstructionsDevelopers can install the server and client from source, or use the bundled release. You can find API documentation here.If the 2.0 software has been installed on your machine previously, you’ll need to delete the existing OpenBazaar2.0 data directory before installation.When running the program the first time, you may need to wait a few moments and click “Retry” if the connection fails.Developer releases include a “Feedback” button to send feedback to our development team. Note the button on the bottom right of the client in the following image.Milestone 2The next milestone focuses on product discovery and communication. Users will be able to search for listings using third party services, and browse listings using the new “channels” feature. Direct chat between users will also be completed.",

For a quick recap, the OpenBazaar program is actually two programs in one:  OpenBazaar server - The server is the back end application which allows OpenBazaar to function as a decentralized application. Each user runs a server to connect them to the network and when users visit stores they are using their server to visit other users’ servers.  OpenBazaar client - The client is the front end application and allows the user to communicate and control the server. The client is the visual interface; it’s what you’re looking at when you run OpenBazaar.In our adventures building this marketplace we have learned firsthand that decentralized apps pose some novel development challenges, such as this latest connectivity issue. We have been working one-on-one with individuals through our community and support channels to try to resolve this problem but have now built a better solution into this new release!

                "content": "In these posts we take a look at some unique members of the OpenBazaar ecosystem and share their stores. Today we are featuring the beautiful handmade women’s clothing store Nuichan! You can view Nuichan in your browser or on OpenBazaar here.    Tell us a bit about yourself. Who are you and what do you make/sell? My name is Yaowalak Nuichan, I was born in a big family (8 sisters and 1 brother) in the South of Thailand in a place called Phatthalung. After finishing high school and university in Bangkok, I worked a few years in 5 star hotels as their Spa Manager. But my true passion was never far away–fashion. My entire family makes clothing, traditional Thai dresses for ceremonial occasions and more modern designs, so it was only a small step for me to change my career and started doing what I’ve seen for the most part of my life. Designing dresses, making patterns and putting it all together. With help from my sisters of course! :) How did you get started selling online? I started selling online as I noticed a growing demand from overseas ( Europe, USA, Middle East, etc.) and it is/was easier for me to supply for my niche market. How did you find out about OpenBazaar? Stumbled upon OpenBazaar via Twitter if I recall correctly. Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? I’m always looking for new markets and for once I want to be part of the start of something which I feel could become really big. I really like the direct link between buyer and seller without an intermediary person/company but the main reason is Bitcoin of course. You also have a very active Etsy shop which is great! How has the approach of dual listing your items there and on OpenBazaar helped you? At the moment I do not have sufficient time to properly monitor this setup as I’m in the process of setting up a new website. I did have some requests in the past from Etsy buyers to pay with Bitcoin, but that has come because I do mention the possibility of paying in bitcoin it in my Etsy listings. So far I haven’t noticed any significant traffic coming from my Etsy shop towards OpenBazaar or the other way around. How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? Actually it has been really good besides some setup issues, but that was mainly due to me not having the technical skills. I had great help from [OB1 Co-Founder] Dr. Washington Sanchez setting up the nodes for both of my shops and guiding me through the set up and also afterward whenever I had any technical issues. Also the guys from Duosear.ch are top notch, they even bought an image from my husband and they use it on their homepage. :)  From a seller’s point of view, I have only had easy, swift transactions so nothing but thumbs up there!How familiar are you with Bitcoin? I’ve been following Bitcoin for a couple of years now and am pretty familiar with it, although I would like to be better at the technical side of things. But everything changes so fast that it is really hard to keep up! What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you? I would love to see some improvements on the back end, making it more user-friendly to make listings, bulk edit, grid overview of products in stock, ability to share listings on social media from within the client. What’s it like behind the scenes of Nuichan? What can you tell us about your design &amp; manufacturing process &amp; doing business day-to-day? My inspiration for our designs comes from my home country, Thailand, with all its wonderful cultures, colors, landscapes, intoxicating smells and the friendly people. But I also allow Western influences to inspire me which helps me to visualize designs and create some more classic looks. Recently I took a trip to Japan to study the amazing shibori technique. This is a traditional manual resist dyeing technique which produces the most stunning patterns. These techniques include cloth wrapping on a diagonal around a pole or pleating sections of the cloth very finely and evenly or sandwiching cloth between two pieces of wood which are held in place with string, just to name a few. The possibilities with this traditional technique are endless and combine perfect with modern dress patterns. Together with my sisters and their 30 years of experience making the patterns and carefully creating each dress I try to keep the business going and growing.   [gallery columns=”4” ids=”1698,1699,1700,1701”]",

                "title": "New Year, New Network", 
                "content": "We are all a part of different networks.Some networks are comprised solely of people, such as an alumni network, whereas other networks are based on a collection of computers talking to each other. Many are a combination of people and computers.Even though it may not sound important, the underlying design of these networks substantially changes how they are used, and what features and limitations they have.The best-known network is the Internet itself.It’s a collection of billions of computers through copper wires, fiberglass cables, cellular towers, and even satellites. This immense network allows an enormous amount of information to move around the world at very little cost, with huge benefits to the people who have access to it.  The underlying design of the Internet is decentralized.This means that there is no central point of control on the Internet. If any particular computer in the network goes down, or even if certain cables are cut, the network as a whole continues functioning. The Internet was specifically built to be decentralized in order to make it robust and resistant to attempts to shut it down and stop the free flow of information.  However, the way most people use the Internet today is largely through centralized networks.Most of the major platforms used for social media or ecommerce today are centrally controlled by certain companies. Even applications that give users the experience of connecting directly with one another, such as Facebook, Etsy or Snapchat, are owned by the companies of those names. As such, they have complete access to–and even ownership of–all of the conversations you have and the content you share on their networks. Unlike the decentralized Internet itself, these companies control the flow of information on their own network.Here is the basic model:[caption id=”” align=”aligncenter” width=”386”] Centralized network[/caption]The outside circles are users, and they are all forced to communicate with the large circle in the middle, controlled by the platform itself. Information moves into and out the servers owned by these businesses and is used for the benefit of the new owners of the data.These centralized networks act as middlemen on top of the Internet itself. These middlemen are extremely popular because they offer value services to their users at low cost, monetary or otherwise. Many charge no money, but they are still paid by collecting all of their users’ data. Some do charge money, especially the ecommerce networks.As widespread as they are though, many of these networks still have restrictions like payment methods that can’t be used, certain items that can’t be sold or they don’t allow users from certain geographical areas to join.Here is the decentralized model:[caption id=”” align=”aligncenter” width=”304”] Decentralized network[/caption]Instead of being forced to use the networks of these middlemen, users can now choose from a variety of decentralized networks which aren’t controlled by any organization; they are fully peer-to-peer (p2p). These networks are decentralized as the Internet itself is decentralized, meaning there is no central point of control, no company collecting all of the users’ data, and no one to make them pay for access to the network. Users can join from any location and don’t need permission.  Decentralized networks provide a way for people to take greater control of their online lives.For an application to be truly p2p, it means that a user’s own computer or node connects directly to another user’s computer or node to communicate, with no stops in between. There are several of these networks being used today, such as:  Bittorrent is a p2p network that gives users the ability to share files between each other.  Bitmessage is a p2p network that gives users the ability to send secure messages to each other.  Retroshare is a p2p network that gives users the ability to participate in a social network without relying on a third party.  Bitcoin is a p2p network that gives users the ability to send digital cash to each other.  OpenBazaar is a p2p network that gives users the ability to engage in ecommerce directly with each other.On these networks people are able to do many of the things they could do on the centralized platforms, with the benefit that they aren’t relying on a middleman anymore.  With Bittorent, they have access to files that other platforms don’t allow.  With Bitmessage, they know that no one else can read their messages.  With Bitcoin and OpenBazaar, they don’t need to ask permission to send money or engage in commerce.Some of these technologies have been around for a few years, and some of them are very new. They are in various stages of development and many lack the features that the centralized platforms have built but they grow stronger every day. It’s unclear how widely these p2p networks will become adopted in the coming years, but it’s of major importance that users now have another choice.  Instead of just choosing between competing middlemen, they can now choose to bypass them altogether and use the Internet as it was originally built. Are you looking for ways to decentralize more of your applications?

                "content": "   When you think about money, you probably don’t think about innovation.  Monetary innovations occurred every few centuries - millennia even - but this is now changing.You may welcome monetary innovation, or fear it, but either way it seems likely to impact our lives in the near future. 2016 saw major gains for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and many expect 2017 to follow suit. Now 8 years in circulation, Bitcoin is approaching adolescence. Instead of wondering what potential it holds, we are beginning to see how it actually is being used. So what is this new money? Is it…  A currency?  An asset?  A commodity?  Digital cash?  Entry in a ledger?  Speculative investment?  Magical internet money?Basically the answer is…yes. It’s all of those things and more.  It’s not just “magical internet money” that is a toy for developers or a lottery ticket for a speculator. Bitcoin is being used more and more each day. The first few years after it launched, there were fewer than 1,000 transactions happening on the network each day. Now there are 300,000 happening each day, and that number continues growing. The same is true for technology built on top of Bitcoin.  OpenBazaar and other Bitcoin-based technologies are still new, but they are being used all over the world.People in the developed world might be uncertain about why they should use something like Bitcoin. If you have cash that mostly keeps its value, and you have access to the credit system, why do you need yet another thing to worry about? For people in places where the monetary system has failed them though, the answer is clear.  Wider adoption of this new monetary innovation matters for everyone.The nature of cryptocurrency is fundamentally different than any sort of economic system we’ve seen in the world.  You don’t need to place your trust in third parties in order for the system to work  No company or government can shut you out of the system; it’s permissionless  No one can censor or reverse your transactions  You aren’t required to tie your identity to your transactions  Transactions are inexpensive and low-cost  The currency can’t be artificially inflated (losing its value)Because of these attributes, people are using Bitcoin for a variety of reasons.  They are using it because it’s more private than credit cards, or because they can’t even get a credit card in the first place.  They are using it because it’s cheaper and faster than existing methods.  They are using it because the government in their country is destroying the value of their national currency.  They are using it because they don’t trust the existing system for a variety of reasons, or because they’re trying to build a new and better system altogether.It’s unclear what will happen in 2017, but it seems likely the monetary innovation of cryptocurrency will play a larger role in our lives than it has before.  Are you looking for a way to use your cryptocurrencies and drive newtechnology forward?

This release is meant solely for developers and those building or intending to build on top of the OpenBazaar platform. The release is not meant for end users and is missing numerous core features needed for engaging in real transactions. Before the launch of the full version of the 2.0 software we will have a formal beta with a fully featured release; details of this formal beta will be posted on this blog soon. We define milestone 1 as such:  Beta Users can download and install the client and server from github, and use it to fill in their profile, store info, and post listings. The network can host listings, stores, and user profiles.This is the bare level of functionality needed for developers to use and understand key aspects of the new design in the 2.0 software. Developers can now begin using the software to post and retrieve data from the OpenBazaar / IPFS network, enabling the building of crawlers, search engines, and other tools.InstructionsDevelopers can install the server and client from source, or use the bundled release. You can find API documentation here. If the 2.0 software has been installed on your machine previously, you’ll need to delete the existing OpenBazaar2.0 data directory before installation. When running the program the first time, you may need to wait a few moments and click “Retry” if the connection fails. Developer releases include a “Feedback” button to send feedback to our development team. Note the button on the bottom right of the client in the following image.Milestone 2The next milestone focuses on product discovery and communication. Users will be able to search for listings using third party services, and browse listings using the new “channels” feature. Direct chat between users will also be completed.  ",

                "title": "3 Ways to Learn What New Technology Really Means for You", 
                "content": "   The connection between people and technology across the world intensified in 2016. We saw the mass adoption of home assistants and AI beating a human at the complex game Go, as well as Pokemon G0 where AR went mainstream for the first time. We saw the launch of OpenBazaar that allowed sales to happen between anyone, anywhere in the world using Bitcoin. Each one of these projects–and thousands of others–represent great strides integrating technology into our daily lives in unprecedented ways. Are all these changes beneficial? These technologies clearly have benefits, but what about their risks? How should we assess emerging technologies in 2017? The questions are only getting tougher as we continue. Even within the Bitcoin community the debate about the future of the blockchain is intense and can be difficult to understand, much less take a stance on, but we have a collective responsibility to take an active part in defining our ongoing relationship with technology.  If we unquestioningly accept or reject new technologies we may face unexpected risks or forgo substantial benefits.Here are some questions to ask about emerging technology in the new year:  What does this technology do?  Who controls this technology?  Who benefits from - and who bears the costs of - this technology?These questions create a simple framework to analyze emerging technologies. Every person has different opinions on what makes technology beneficial. This post is meant to give the user a framework, not meant to convey any sort of objective analysis (though the opinions of the author will be displayed).1. What does this technology do?In order to determine if an emerging technology is beneficial, you must know what it does. While this sounds obvious, it’s all too common for people to dismiss emerging technology as not beneficial (or even harmful) without even taking the time to understand how it works. Adam Thierer, technology policy expert, explains so-called “techno-panics” where people act unreasonably towards the threats of emerging technology. If you look at the details of most emerging technologies you’ll find the specific action they enable is typically somewhat tame and nothing to be afraid of, but some take the worst case scenario and play on people’s fears and ignorance of the new technology.2. Who controls this technology?A core aspect of technology is its dynamic nature. A technology doesn’t spring into existence and remain static, but grows and changes over time. It’s important to understand who controls this technology in order to properly assess how beneficial it is, and over what time scale the costs or benefits will remain, or be lost. If a technology is purely digital, then it’s important to determine if it is open or closed source. Open source technology means the code is available for everyone to look at and use, whereas closed source technology is controlled only by those building it. Technology built on closed source code may not be malicious and may be beneficial to its users; many of the most popular applications are closed source. Unfortunately, there are dangers in used closed source technology. First, you don’t know exactly what it is doing. Since no one but the builders have access to the code, you are forced to trust that they aren’t doing anything harmful. Second, even if you currently trust them, with closed source you need to trust them forever. This makes assessing the benefit of technologies built on closed source code difficult. What was beneficial yesterday might be malicious tomorrow, and you wouldn’t know. With open source project, developers are able to see what the code is doing and see when it changes. They can relay this information to everyone so that no one needs to place so much trust in the builders. If control of a technology is closely held by a single organization or small group of people, then you are forced to trust their motivations currently as well as in the future. If the control of the technology is distributed to all its users and not held by a small group, trust isn’t needed.3. Who benefits from - and who bears the costs of - this technology?At first glance it seems obvious that the people who benefit from emerging technologies are whoever is using them. At some level this is true; in most cases people aren’t using a certain technology unless they believe it is helping them. However, not everyone is aware of the costs involved with using some technologies. There are trade-offs associated with nearly all technologies. Some trade-offs are obvious. Buying the newest technology typically costs more money than existing technologies. Purchasing the vehicle with the most recent safety improvements will likely be more expensive than older (but less safe) models. The newest smartphones cost the most. These are easy to see. Other times the trade-offs are more difficult to calculate.Examples1. What does this technology do?There are many examples of emerging technologies that people don’t take time to understand. Drones are machines that make flying substantially cheaper and more accessible to the general population, and the vast majority of drone owners are responsible and pose no threats to others. However, due to conflating drones with large military drones used overseas in combat zones, and a few infrequent cases of irresponsible drone owners, some fear the worst from a society where drone use is common. Understanding how drones work - including their limitations - should help allay those fears.2. Who controls this technology?There are numerous examples of a technology initially having noble intentions and eventually straying from them due to them being controlled by a small group.Paypal is an example. Peter Thiel co-founded Paypal, and described a vision for Paypal that would compete with government issued currency and protect users from inflation. Years later, Paypal has been unable to deliver on Thiel’s vision, while another emerging technology - Bitcoin - has begun to do just that. This is because of who controls the two technologies. Paypal is controlled by a company and must respond to company leadership, shareholders, and governments. Bitcoin is controlled by no central organization and no one is forced to trust that any company, group of shareholders, or government won’t change it for the worse - because they can’t.No matter how noble the intentions of the creators are, nor how beneficial the technology is today, if it’s controlled by a small group then you cannot be certain those benefits will remain over time.3. Who benefits from - and who bears the costs of - this technology?The traditional model for online shopping is an example of unseen costs. A buyer may chose Amazon or Alibaba because of convenience and selection. The process of buying is simple and quick, and the prices are usually pretty good. What a buyer doesn’t see are the costs associated, both to himself and to the seller.The most obvious cost is the cut taken from the transaction itself, typically around 10 or 15%. The seller typically passes on some of the costs to the buyer, meaning they are effectively paying higher prices due to those fees.Another cost is the loss of data from both parties. The platform now knows more information about both parties involved. They can take that information and build detailed profiles about the users, and use that information themselves or sell that information to others. There is a cost associated with the risk that the platform will be hacked and your private information stolen, especially credit card information. Identity theft and online fraud are rampant, largely due to online retailers having their security breached.Other costs are less obvious. Buyers and sellers are shown a curated and censored marketplace of goods and services. The platforms tightly control their own marketplaces with terms and conditions and are willing to censor trade for their own benefit or on behalf of governments. You may not have access to the best products because of behind the scenes deals, or the platform may remove products you love in favor of cheaper products you don’t want.Perhaps the least obvious cost is the exclusion of users from this system who don’t have access to credit. Users who are unable to obtain a credit card, either due to their geographical location or socioeconomic status, aren’t able to participate in the system at all. Users in the system aren’t even aware of their exclusion and will never know what goods or services they could have offered or purchased.Using Bitcoin and OpenBazaar for online commerce have their own trade-offs, but avoid some of the costs mentioned above. With both Bitcoin and OpenBazaar…  No organization controls the technology; it is completely distributed.  No company, group of developers, or government controls the open source code.  Users need not fear about a small group exerting control and straying from the original intentions of the project.Everyone who uses the technology benefits from not relying on middlemen. Users don’t pay fees, don’t have their data collected, and don’t have their trade censored. The costs are also borne by the same users, needing to run the software on their computers and connecting to the internet.  OpenBazaar doesn’t exclude any users from the system.What emerging technologies most interest you in 2017?

You can view Tyler Nieman’s store in your browser or on OpenBazaar here.      Tell us a bit about yourself? My name is Tyler Nieman and I’m a full-stack web developer/designer, artist, gamer, and general all-around nerd currently living in Tacoma, WA. I run @tsnieman on OpenBazaar. How did you find out about OpenBazaar? Probably by means of some Bitcoin-related subreddit. I’ve been learning a lot more about decentralization and cryptocurrencies in general lately, and OpenBazaar is a big name in that space. What do you make/sell? A lot of different stuff with no real specialty carved out yet. Right now I’ve got: some 12x18 locally screen-printed posters of my original Fox-themed artwork, rare vinyl (The Weeknd’s “Trilogy”, hand-numbered), some computer parts, a mechanical keyboard (with some fun free keycaps!), and my own by-the-hour full-stack development and design services. Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? I think decentralization is a very powerful concept and I’m excited to learn more about it. OpenBazaar seems like a great way to do that. It’s proving a great way to learn about how decentralized markets can work, cryptocurrencies, open source development, and even just general server maintenance practice. It’s a great way to network with other people in the space too. How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? Fantastic for such an early version of the concept! I’ve only been up and running for a week or two, so I haven’t had any real sales. I’ve made a purchase (shoutout to Cryptobooks!) and I’m eagerly awaiting the arrival of “The Internet of Money”, a book by Andreas Antonopoulos. I’m finding so many great shops online by so many talented people. I’m hoping to open up another shop or two with more focused themes, as I really believe in what OpenBazaar could be. How familiar are you with Bitcoin? I learned about it years ago, when it was first coming out, though I didn’t get into playing with it until 2013 or so (what a shame, right?). It wasn’t until the last year or two that it really started to become a serious hobby/interest. Since then, I’ve consumed a lot of Satoshi’s writings, bought a few hardware wallets (shoutout to LedgerHQ -- check out their OpenBazaar shop!), got a few friends interested, dabbled in other cryptoassets, started connecting people with Bitcoin in the area, and recently started a local Tacoma Bitcoin interest group. I’m hoping to compile some educational material and educate more local folk soon. What changes would you like to see in OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you? Aside from all the awesome work coming in OpenBazaar 2.0, more folks on the platform and shopping would be the biggest improvement. I would also really love if there was a way to see some analytics like number of vendors online (and over time), number of sales per day, etc, though I imagine that getting people on OpenBazaar and making sales is first priority. I’m excited to see how OB1 helps grow OpenBazaar’s community and tech with their most recent round of fundraising.

                "content": "The OpenBazaar ecosystem features hundreds of vendors from around the world who want to list their goods and services for free, set their prices, and get paid in bitcoin. Buyers can purchase items ranging from clothing, food, electronics and home decor to applied services and digital products in this marketplace and often for lower prices than those available elsewhere on the web. In these posts we take a look at some unique members of the OpenBazaar ecosystem. Today we are featuring Honey France (Best Honey on Earth), a quaint little store selling delicious French honey from their own family-kept bees and trying to make the world a better place. They are no strangers to using Bitcoin and have a pioneering story that will make your stomach drop a little! You can find Honey France on OpenBazaar here and browse their listings on the web here.      How did you find out about OpenBazaar? Since we work with computers and are admirers of open source initiatives, we have been following the development of OpenBazaar with interest, after reading about it on the bitcointalk forum. What do you make/sell? We mainly sell our honey production of the year, but shipping costs remain our main concern. Recently, we added two donation initiatives to help save the bees: a small donation, since the bitcoin simplifies micro-payments, or to adopt a queen from one of our hives for a season and to be more involved in the preservation of pollinators, who are essential to our survival. In the same principle, we will propose the adoption of a whole hive for the season: the “Bee part of the solution” project ;-) Soon, we will add honey &amp; spice mixes for your gourmet recipes. For our honey, we had fun writing an offbeat description addressed to “geeks”, most likely the early-adopters of OpenBazaar. Have a look at the presentation page of one of our jars of honey on Duosear.ch. Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? We like all decentralization initiatives. This is probably a habit of those of us who live in the French countryside, since our politicians and leaders think that only Paris exists in France ;-) We also like the idea of introducing the bitcoin to others: reduction of fraud, no borders, Escrow system, micro-payments… So finally, it’s not only because there is no fee that we prefer OpenBazaar to eBay. How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? We started the adventure by installing OpenBazaar on our family iMac and then to avoid leaving it on permanently, we transferred our store to a RaspberryPi II. But the server was unstable and difficult to monitor, so we decided to install it on a dedicated server. This was not the initial idea, since we didn’t want subscription fees for our store. After an unsuccessful installation on an existing hosted server (mostly difficulties installing the libsodium library), we had the pleasure of using the Deploy solution from OB1 where everything was installed in 1 click. We are hoping that version 2 of OpenBazaar will be released before the end of our 2 free months with DigitalOcean :-) We didn’t expect a miracle when we opened our honey store. We have been faced with expensive international shipping fees for heavy jars, and current visitors are not really interested in this kind of product, since they generally prefer to buy locally. Our two other offers may be more successful: the protection &amp; survival of bees is an international challenge. But using OpenBazaar is not limited to opening a store, we also made some purchases and enjoy this great marketplace. For a first version, all the processes were very well thought out. How familiar are you with Bitcoin? We were among the first to mine bitcoins, when it was only experimental (as admin of an Xserve farm). We are virtual millionaires, like many who started mining bitcoins at the beginning, never imaging how valuable it would become. We lost our key by the replacement hard drives or other breakdowns, and it was only in 2013 that we cried when we discovered the fortune and number of hives we could have had, with the several thousand bitcoins we had mined at the very beginning. That’s learning about the crypto world the hard way. ;-) What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you? With the arrival of Duosearch, the link between the web and OpenBazaar has become easier, but it’s not enough. In addition to a currency still too confidential, the need to install a special software to purchase on the platform doesn’t help. Fortunately, the great diversity of products available has aroused the curiosity of some adventurers. For mainstream use, the acquisition of bitcoins by OpenBazaar shoppers needs to be facilitated, even if they only acquire them for their purchases, and without having to install a client software. It is our understanding that these 2 improvements are planned, including the evolutions related to shipping fees, which is essential, and the addition of visitor statistics, which will motivate us from time to time. Finally, we would like to add a very specific request: to be able to present our store in different languages. Currently, the UI adapts to French, but the product descriptions remain in one language. We would like to present our products in the native language of our potential and probably our main customers, given the cost of shipping. And also in English so that the whole world can discover our products (and why not in German/Italian/Spanish, our close neighbors). But please not an automatic translator, that would be catastrophic. As you can see, we are impatiently awaiting version 2 because it looks very promising. Good luck to the developers!Would you like to have a store on OpenBazaar?

                "content": "We’re pleased to announce that OB1 has raised a new round of funding in order to make OpenBazaar the most free and open trade platform in the world. Last year, OpenBazaar entered a new phase when the core development team received funding to create a company in order to properly develop the peer-to-peer trade platform. OB1 worked hard, together with developers from the community, to release OpenBazaar 1.0 in April. Seeing people around the world trading without middlemen and only using Bitcoin has been exciting, and after learning how to make major improvements we’re now working to make peer-to-peer trade better than ever with the 2.0 version of the software. Details of the new funding are in the press release below. We’re fortunate to have investors who understand the value of networks, decentralization, and Bitcoin. We believe that with such good investors, developers, and our community, we can fundamentally change how online commerce is done. Let’s make trade free!Press ReleaseOpenBazaar Company OB1 Raises New Funding RoundWashington, DC, — Dec 13, 2016 – OpenBazaar-based company OB1 today announced it has raised a new round of funding from BlueYard, Union Square Ventures, and Andreessen Horowitz totalling $3 million in order to further its mission of making trade free for everyone, everywhere. Brad Burnham - managing partner at Union Square Ventures - said, “The reach and diversity of OpenBazaar usage shows the potential for decentralized applications: within a week of its release, buyers and sellers from 129 countries joined the network and began transacting with each other for free. We believe OpenBazaar has an opportunity to fundamentally transform the market structure of commerce, and we’re excited to welcome BlueYard as a new partner and co-investor in OB1.” OB1 previously raised a $1 million seed round from Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and angel investor William Mougayar in May of 2015 in order to build and launch OpenBazaar, a completely decentralized marketplace that allows anyone in the world to buy and sell anything to anyone else, anywhere, for free. The peer-to-peer software isn’t controlled by any company or organization, allowing its participants to engage in trade directly with each other using Bitcoin. By removing the intermediaries for commerce online, OpenBazaar enables its users to avoid paying fees or having their trade controlled by middlemen. OpenBazaar has been used by tens of thousands of people internationally since its launch in April of this year. This new round of funding will allow OB1 - with assistance from contributors around the world -  to continue improving the open source software and growing the peer-to-peer trade community. OB1 is among an ecosystem of businesses building on the OpenBazaar software and offering their own services to users on the network. OB1 CEO Brian Hoffman said, “After launch we were so excited to see how people have been using OpenBazaar, and with this new funding we’re confident it will allow us to bring the benefits of truly free and open trade to the world.” The OB1 team has written about their vision for the future of OpenBazaar - including the upcoming 2.0 version of the software - in this article.Join usWe have a great community behind this open source project. If you’d like to join our community, come visit us in our Slack group. If you’re a developer, we’d love help with the 2.0 version of the software, both client and server repositories. If you’re not a developer but you’ve used OpenBazaar, we want to hear from you in order to make the 2.0 version the best it can be. We have a buyer survey and a vendor survey to learn what works and what doesn’t.",

                "content": "  During the 2016 holiday weekend, global online sales have seen a significant nudge upwards. At the same time, payment card fraud increased by a whopping 20%. Consumer’s financial details are always at risk when dealing with payment cards these days. Bitcoin is a far safer option, as there is no sensitive personal information leaked during the transaction process. Source: 2016 Holiday Shopping Fraud Report Shows Bitcoin Remains Most SecureIf you are active in the Bitcoin space this is likely no surprise to you, so accept this as more reinforcement that you are on the right path. Huzzah! Cheers to you, friend. But if you are still fairly new here (or have a friend or family member who is) then first, welcome! Second, here is a quick crash course in why you should use bitcoin as at least a part of your 2016 holiday spending bonanza.  Bitcoin is stable. Now in its 7th year of open development, Bitcoin is still the largest and most used cryptocurrency and has achieved a stability that has rivaled that of gold. This solid status shows no signs of stopping.  Bitcoin is secure. Like the article above states, no sensitive information can be leaked during a transaction online since it isn’t transmitted to begin with. There’s also no way to steal said non-existent information by scanning your handbag or wallet as you walk by!  There are lots of places to shop using bitcoin. You can use bitcoin easily in any OpenBazaar store of course, or shop at many of the ecommerce websites that now offer a bitcoin payment option. You can also browse other interesting marketplaces like purse.io.  It’s the future. It’s becoming clear that the age of credit cards is in decline but the need for powerful, secure, international electronic payments is higher than ever. New advancements such as EMV technology are only addressing a fraction of the problem with centralized credit and encountering many logistical issues on the road to rollout. While credit companies and merchants continue to fight over how to bandage this leaking system, you don’t have to wait to get ahead. You can already earn or buy bitcoin at any time now and begin learning how it works!  Still need some bitcoin?

                "title": "How to Choose a Good Moderator on OpenBazaar", 
                "content": "  “I think of a hero as someone who understands the degree of responsibility that comes with his freedom.” - Bob Dylan (1941 - ), American Singer-Songwriter, Musician, and PoetEveryone likes the idea of freedom, right? To do what you want when you want to is a nice concept on which most of us can agree. We also know that exercising our freedom comes with the responsibility of making good decisions. A decentralized network is a practical place to apply this dream of freedom, a place where a buyer and a seller can trade directly with one another and not have anyone else telling them what they can or can’t do. It’s a space that offers a lot of opportunity but there is also risk involved when strangers first gather together to buy and sell–and trust that outweighs or eliminates risk is necessary for building a lasting business network. How do you establish trust on a free network where people there will likely never know one another through anything other than pixels on a screen? Our solution on OpenBazaar is to introduce an objective third party on individual transactions. Presently there are two types of ways for buyers to send payment to vendors in OpenBazaar:  Direct Payment - The buyer sends his bitcoin directly to the vendor and trusts that the vendor will then send the goods purchased.Direct payment is risky because once bitcoins are sent the payment cannot be reversed. If the vendor is dishonest they can take the payment and not send the product. We recommend that buyers only use direct payments if they completely trust the vendor and are dealing with small amounts of bitcoin.  Moderated Payment - The buyer adds a third party to the transaction, called a moderator, to provide assistance in the case of a dispute. Moderated payments are much more secure.Moderators and Multisig AccountsA moderator is a type of user on the OpenBazaar network who helps offer a secure payment method called moderated payment. The buyer adds a moderator and then pays their Bitcoins into a sort of escrow address, called a multisignature or “multisig” address, which is then jointly controlled by the buyer, the vendor, and the moderator. In order for the funds to leave the multisig, any two of these parties need to agree how to release the funds. (Read more about how multisig accounts work here: Can Bitcoin and Multisig Reduce Identity Theft and Fraud?) In most cases a transaction will go through smoothly, the buyer and vendor are both happy, and they agree to release the funds. In that case the moderator isn’t even aware they were chosen to provide escrow and they don’t receive a fee. If the transaction doesn’t go smoothly and the buyer or seller open a dispute, then the moderator will provide resolution. The moderator will determine which party is at fault, and will then join with the winning party to release the funds (either release payment to the vendor or refund the buyer). In return for offering this service, the moderator will receive a percentage of the transaction called a dispute fee. These fees are displayed when selecting a moderator and can be viewed by visiting the moderator’s page as well.Choosing a ModeratorIt’s very important for the buyer to select a trustworthy moderator for this arrangement to work. If a moderator is dishonest he can join with the other party to release funds regardless of the situation. If a moderator is unresponsive then a buyer and seller can be locked in a disagreement with no way out. Currently anyone can become a moderator on the OpenBazaar network and we would like to provide some advice on how to select someone trustworthy!  Scope them out in advanceCheck out their profiles and look for these 2 things in particular:  A posted moderator agreement  An email addressAnd it’s also very helpful if they are active in our Slack. The best way to find that out now is to join Slack and ask around or ask them directly.  Make contactUsing the contact information available in the index, reach out to a moderator to gauge their responsiveness and ask them a few questions! We recommend:  Why have you chosen to be a moderator on OpenBazaar?  How many disputes have you settled? Can you tell me about some of them?  Are you in the OpenBazaar Slack? What is your username?  Start smallThis environment is still very grassroots so start building relationships here the same way you would online. If you are still wary, start with just a small purchase to try them &amp; the vendor out to minimize your risk. If all goes well then continue on with your adventures and let others know; word of mouth referrals are an excellent way to help others build their reputation and move around confidently in the marketplace!Want to get to know some people and do some stuff?

My name is Tomis and I come from Thessaloniki, a town located in northern Greece. I graduated from Mechanical Engineering in Aristotle Polytechnic School of Thessaloniki. I have studied jewelry-making since 1986 and went professional in 1994 when I opened my retail shop. By the end of 2015 I thought I should try and go international using e-commerce sites because I wanted to see if people worldwide like my creations. Every single time, It’s one of the best moments in my life when looking at customers’ expressions and enthusiasm when asked to tell me if they enjoy my jewelry. All items are handmade and manufactured by me completely. Silver and gold in primary form take their final shape through the usage of techniques rarely used in the pro world, like fusion, which renders the junctions between gold and silver unbreakable. I love traveling the world! I’m so intrigued by the unknown and the different and I have been led by my insatiable appetite for excitement to the heights of Himalaya and scuba diving in one of the deepest seas in the world. I have been a fan of extreme sports since childhood, my eyes have seen a lot. In all my endeavors I have found various sources of inspiration for my jewels. The oceans, the rocks and the landscape helped me imagine and design the current collection, which I hope you enjoy as much as I do. Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? My cousins introduced me to Bitcoin and OpenBazaar. I find it very interesting and I am keen to accept the new currency and be part of this new global marketplace.

I’ve also written for Bitcoin Magazine, been featured in other Bitcoin publications, been a regular panelist on The Bitcoin Group, appeared on radio shows and podcasts speaking on Bitcoin, had my own interview show on Youtube, spoken at conferences around the country, and organized two Bitcoin conferences. Most recently, I was the Community Manager at Airbitz and manage Andreas Antonopoulos’ store CryptoBooks on OpenBazaar. My non-bitcoin projects include writing on Medium.com, speaking at conferences, and appearing on a fun and feisty radio show called Freedom Feens. What do you make/sell? ** I manage the store CryptoBooks which sells books by Andreas Antonopoulos. **Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? ** A decentralized, peer-to-peer marketplace is an exciting concept and goes hand in hand with crypto. It makes sense that some of the most radical literature on the subject would be sold on a radical platform like OpenBazaar. **How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? ** It’s been educational, a pretty good for a platform in this stage. I’m used to testing new tech projects and understanding of the time it takes to smooth out platforms. I find it fairly easy to use and can’t wait to see the improvements in the next release. **How familiar are you with Bitcoin? ** I have a better social understanding of Bitcoin but also grasp the technical overview. While I don’t have a tech background, I can explain the concepts to others especially if they aren’t as tech savvy as programmers. I created a lot of content for Airbitz breaking down complex, technical concepts into easier to understand explanations. While Airbitz is a bitcoin app and broader security platform, being involved in Bitcoin helped me better understand other concepts like encryption, decentralized platforms, and security. I’ve spent bitcoin on a huge variety of products and am so glad it’s become way easier to use than a few years ago when I first started using it. Andreas was a huge part in inspiring me to stay active in the Bitcoin space and I am curious to see what the future brings. **What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you? The orders need to be more logically organized. It doesn’t seem very intuitive and if you are dealing with large amounts of orders, that they rearrange without any seeming structure can make it confusing to keep track of them. Also, being able to edit the orders after they have been marked as shipped would be a great addition to keep track of any issues. Being able to search for the name of the purchaser along with the order ID and product would also be great. A way for notifications to get to you outside the platform if that’s possible would be very helpful. If these issues can be addressed with the next release, I think OB will be more of a game changer and have broader appeal.Would you like to have a store on OpenBazaar?

                "content": "In these posts we take a look at some unique members of the OpenBazaar ecosystem. Today we interview a vendor selling his own hand-made jewelry, Tom Woods Jewelry, who was connected enough to be shared by his friends with us on Twitter! You can find Tom Woods Jewelry on OpenBazaar here and on Duosearch here.  Tell us a bit about yourself? ** I’m a retired educator having taught incarcerated adults in the Vermont state prison system. In addition, I’ve had longtime interests in computer programming and electronic design, oil painting, and collecting rocks. I live in the heart of New Hampshire’s White Mountains, which has pretty good rockhounding sites. I got started faceting stones after finding a beautiful green gemstone while walking along some abandoned railroad tracks. It took a long time to gather the equipment and expertise I needed, but after probably six years I was faceting. I started to amass lots of finished gems and I wanted to do something with them. I couldn’t afford to buy jewelry settings for them all, but I told myself, if I can facet a stone, I should be able to make my own jewelry settings. So as soon as I retired and had the energy and time, I took soldering and metals classes at the Littleton Studio School in Littleton, NH. I’m still involved with L.S.S. It is just so great to be able to talk and share ideas with the great artists and crafts people there. (Read more about Tom on his website at tomscooljewels.blogspot.com!) **What do you make/sell? What I like to do is collect stones, both locally and around the country. I fashion them into faceted stones or cabochons, which are smoothly shaped and polished stones. Finally, I make the jewelry into which I set my finished stones. I am especially interested in working with stones that have some fascinating local history, or legend. Almost all stones have not just their physical beauty, but they also have deep metaphysical properties that have spiritual, magical, mystical significance. I try to weave this lore into my work because some people, including me, are keenly interested in it. I can’t say for sure that stones possess magical or healing powers. I suspect some do, and I know for a fact there is one stone that I cannot keep close to my body because it makes me sick. But the ancient traditions and mystery wrapped around stones is terribly fascinating. It gives us different ways to appreciate stones. It helps connect us to the earth, and sometimes, beyond. Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? When I taught, one of my classes was about personal finance and investment. Through that, I became interested in macroeconomics and where money comes from. I was shocked when I grasped the implications of our present day fractional reserve system, and I began looking at Bitcoin and other crypto currencies as a possible hedge. I offer jewelry on a blog, TomsCoolJewels.blogspot.com, and have accepted bitcoin there. I probably never would have tried OpenBazaar were it not for my Twitter friend, @BitcoinBelle, who encouraged me to have a look. So I did, and I liked the store format. It’s neat and simple, way easier than adding new jewelry to my blog. So the store went up, with some bumps to be sure, but I am happy with how it looks. How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? I am extremely pleased with how my store looks and how easily I can add new products. There were hurdles to jump to get there. The two main problems were overcoming connection problems and making a server that would be up all the time (I finally settled on a low power single board unix computer called the NVIDIA Tegra TK1). The disappointment is there does not appear to be throngs of willing buyers jamming into my store and taking all my product, paying in bitcoin :) Part of this might be an OpenBazaar critical mass problem. Another piece of the puzzle is bitcoin’s volatility. When the dollar value of bitcoin fluctuates 30% up or down, the coin becomes more a tool for speculators than for trading in goods and services. When Bitcoin goes up, it’s the equivalent of deflation in the fiat world. There is no incentive to buy now when you can hold onto your money and buy the same product for less if you wait. This is an impossible situation for business, whether we are talking about dollar deflation or bitcoin deflation. How familiar are you with Bitcoin? I feel I am quite familiar, actually. I understand the way the blockchain works and how blocks must be solved, I’ve tried mining my own bitcoin, but soon gave that up when the block rewards didn’t even come close to paying the electric bill. What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you? Keep improving the client and server software to make it easy and idiot-proof for users so OpenBazaar can increase its user base. Prospective store owners are not necessarily wanting to spend hours of time fussing over computer issues. I would love to see a sort of bitcoin/currency exchange system developed whereby buyers could pay in dollars or maybe other fiat currencies. Right now, I suspect a good piece of business is lost because there aren’t enough buyers that hold bitcoin they want to spend, but they might be willing to use dollars. Along a similar line, a great improvement would be to make it possible to update all my prices so they reflect fluctuating bitcoin exchange prices. Right now when bitcoin goes up a lot versus the dollar, I have to edit each of my products to bring the price in line with the new dollar value. If I could tie my prices to the dollar and then list a bitcoin price that adjusts automatically, it would be a great time saver. (EDIT: This is possible by setting prices to your present fiat currency in Settings!)",

Creating a listing, selling and communicating with customers is easy and our server has been running smoothly for the last 6 months. There is one thing, however,  preventing us (and similar or bigger companies) from selling most of the time: there is no granular management of shipping and taxes (see last question). **How familiar are you with Bitcoin? ** Some people at Ledger have a significant Bitcoin balance, and our engineers understand how Bitcoin works, which is of course crucial to developing our firmwares, software and backends. **What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you? ** We think it is very important for OpenBazaar to implement granular (but of course optional) shipping and taxes management. Companies should be able, for each listing, to set a shipping cost and a tax rate for each destination country, using an “Expert Mode” or something similar. This would cover most, if not all, problems arising when selling worldwide. When a cost or a tax changes, OpenBazaar won’t even have to change anything: the user can simply change his parameters.",

Just want to browse? Check them out on Duosearch and at BitcoinNotBombs.com      Tell us a bit about yourself? My background is in media production but I don’t get to do much of that these days. In 2008 I became interested in economics and caught the silver bug and alternative currencies became a hobby of mine. When I first heard about Bitcoin in 2011 I was immediately intrigued. In 2012 I started selling silver dime cards on Bitmit.net and began working with Davi Barker on creating more products we could sell. In 2013 Davi and I took the Bitcoin Not Bombs product line to the first US Bitcoin conference in San Jose, we were blown away by the response. We knew this would be a great niche market but at that one event we sold out of almost everything we had. Back then people were buying products for bitcoin just to show support for the currency. I see a lot of that same excitement with OpenBazaar today. The Bitcoin Not Bombs logo has been printed on t-shirts, hoodies, lapel pins, patches, stickers, shot glasses and other small items over the last few years. We have also collaborated on a few large art projects like the world’s first coin operated voting machine. The brand and logo means different things to different people and we like it that way. These days we have reduced our inventory to only the small items sold on OpenBazaar and Purse.io. Many of Davi’s t-shirt designs can be found at store.bitcoin.com and a lot of our work goes to supporting antiwar efforts. Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? Because it matters, though I’m somewhat disappointed that less than 300 vendors are still actively selling items on the network. I know thousands more have downloaded the client and set up stores but lost interest. In the summer of ‘15 one of the OB developers asked us if we could list our small low risk items when the software became available. I was ready with our first listing on day one, a lapel pin that supports the FreeRoss.org campaign. In some ways OpenBazaar is the conclusion of the Silk Road experiment, I wanted people to see that connection and offer this lapel pin from the beginning. How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? Great! Things where buggy in the beginning but I was happy to ride that out, I saw the development team pushing updates constantly so I knew it would get better fast. Things run very smooth now and I still get a few orders a month, I suspect everyone will see a second wave of orders once version 2.0 is available. How familiar are you with Bitcoin? Fairly familiar, I’m not a programmer or computer expert but I have read a lot of technical information on how Bitcoin works. One reason I stuck with it was that I knew it would only be a few years before the wallets became extremely easy to use. At this point you don’t need to know how Bitcoin works under the hood to use it, but a better understanding of the technology will lead to more adoption. What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you? Not having a way to combined shipping cost on orders is my biggest complaint, but I have seen that a better shopping cart system will become available in version 2.0 along with variable data like size and color. Does your store have any special promotions? For Bitcoin Black Friday we will offer free US shipping and a free gift for international orders.",

Bitcoin provides a means to make donations transparent, and through OpenBazaar, we are reaching people worldwide. To make donations transparent, we use the Food Bank’s bitcoin address (1ARxKuBArW8XzJQNGoRC5RZBVqhb4Tx5yx) found on centraltexasfoodbank.org/bitcoin, and you can write off any donation made to the the Food Bank for tax purposes (optional, as anonymous donations are more than welcome!!!).          Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? ** The idea came to me after spending an absurd amount of time helping my mom donate to an organization. The amount of personal details and time required needed to make a simple donation was burdensome and unnecessary. The current donation model bombards people by stealing their time and attention, which is priceless, by inviting counterparty risk and friction to philanthropic campaigns, which removes a lot of incentive for people to give. OpenBazaar enables “zero-marginal-cost charities” with no interference with government regulation. It’s free to download and use. It’s permissionless, borderless, and available to anyone with a computer and internet connection. OpenBazaar removes many barriers that otherwise exist in banking and philanthropy. OpenBazaar donations can bring a lot of awareness to causes that need assistance while sending a message to the world about the viability of decentralized marketplace and microdonations. More stories about the “good” a decentralized application can do and the amount of people we can empower are the stories we plan to bring to the entire crypto ecosystem.   **How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? When I heard about OpenBazaar before the beta release, all I knew is I wanted to be involved. I joined the beta on day one and opened a luxury watch store with a friend from high school called Justin Time. I am not a watch guy, but my buddy, who the director of timepieces at a well-respected diamond company in Dallas, TX, has years of experience in the industry. We decided to partner, and before I knew it, I was spending all my time learning about OpenBazaar. It has been exciting to see OpenBazaar stores, listings, and community grow. The OpenBazaar Slack channel is an incredible resource for anyone to learn how to use OpenBazaar, regardless of eCommerce or technical experience. The OB1 crew work like robots and are extremely responsive to questions. Also, OB1 CEO, Brian Hoffman, was the first to donate to the Food Bank while newly hired OB1 developer, Tyler Smith, provides the server to host our store. It truly is a community that all projects in this space can learn from.   How familiar are you with Bitcoin? We aren’t Satoshi, but we live Bitcoin daily. No movies or T.V. series provides the amount of comedy, drama (forks), tragedy (hacks), or overall entertainment that the Bitcoin community does. We teach Bitcoin literacy through Bitcoin Awakens and host weekly Bitcoin Meetups every Monday in Austin, TX. You don’t need to know everything about Bitcoin &amp; blockchain technologies and there there are plenty of ways to familiarize yourself with the concepts and theory of it. But, we want to teach people how to take advantage of Bitcoin and show them how to apply it in their own lives. We want them to experience Bitcoin and give them the knowledge and power to build a better life for themselves and their family.   What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you? Most of the changes I look forward to will be implemented in version 2.0 (IPFS, Auctions, Inventory Management, statistics, etc.). However, I do have some suggestions:  Remove the minimum listing price. This would enable micro-transactions and potentially, increase donations to charitable causes. With no minimum price, anyone would be able to list free items they need to get rid of or offer up volunteer opportunities.  Store Templates and the ability to save drafts of store listings.  Pre-schedule the date for listings to be posted.  More third party integrations.The Cyberfunks Alliance is onboarding potential customers and you can take advantage of the relationship with the customer right from the start. OB Stores interested in donating in-kind any Bitcoin novelty/paraphernalia, hosting services, crypto art, hardware wallets, etc., or offer discounts should reach out to us on our Slack.

                "content": "Today we’ve released version 1.1.8, the first release in a few months. This release adds several new features for vendors as well as a significant amount of bug fixes and code improvements. You can download this new version on the openbazaar.org page. We’ve also created an installer which only contains the client for users who have a server hosted remotely (such as a VPS) and don’t need a local server installation. If you want to use the client-only installer, visit the Download page and choose the “Client Only” installer for your operating system.FeaturesPinned listingsVendors can now choose certain listings they want highlighted in their stores. When creating a listing, or editing an existing listing, vendors can select “Pinned” if they want that listing to be displayed to buyers at the top of their storefront. There is no limit to how many listings may be Pinned, all Pinned listings will be shown before un-Pinned listings.Hidden listingsVendors can now create Hidden listings. When creating a listing, or edit an existing listing, vendors can select “Hidden” if they don’t want visitors to their store to see that listing. The vendor can still see it, though it will be faded out to indicate it is hidden. However, these listings can still be visited with the listing address, allowing vendors to create private listings that are only visible to people they give the listing address. This feature allows vendors to have more control over who can access their listings, and when. (Note that the client will not display listings with a “hidden” flag to people using the client, but third parties crawling nodes can still see the listings).Maximum QuantityVendors can now set a maximum quantity on their listings, which prevents a buyer from purchasing more than the number of items they specify in one order. This gives vendors a simple inventory management system. If the Max Quantity is set to zero, the item is still visible, but cannot be purchased. [caption id=”attachment_1111” align=”aligncenter” width=”648”] New listing features shown in red[/caption]ImprovementsAddressesWe’ve made the following improvements to addresses:  The first address in the Addresses tab of Settings is now marked as the Default Address.  Addresses in the Addresses tab of Settings can now be reordered by dragging.  Addresses are now more flexible. Only the name and country are required, and a new contact method field has been added.  The appearance of very long addresses in the purchase flow has been improved.ImagesWe’ve made the following improvements to images:  The Avatar in the Page tab of Settings can now be rotated with rotation buttons.  The buyer and seller avatar pictures now appear on the close dispute form for moderators.  When images are uploaded to listings, if the image has an orientation in its EXIF data (for example, if it was taken on a phone in landscape mode), the image will automatically be rotated to match the orientation.ShippingWe’ve made the following improvements to shipping:  The list of shippable countries in the address panel of the purchase modal has been removed, it was made obsolete by the Shipping tab in the listing page.  The “ships to” field in the edit listing screen now has a clear all button.  Listings have a “Ships From” field now, so each listing can have a different shipping origin. It defaults to the Country value set in Settings/General.Miscellaneous  Various optimizations have been made to the following, follower, and store tabs in the User Page, and to the Discover view, which should speed up rendering and reduce the strain on the Chromium browser.  The last view is now saved per-node. This means if you connect the client to a different node, the last view saved for that node will be loaded, instead of trying to load the view the current node was on.  Listings in the Store tab are now ordered by most recently saved.  Tags have a maximum length of 40 characters. Old longer tags are truncated at 90px wide.  Chat messages are never shown for blocked GUIDs.  The language for NSFW was updated to “Adult or Offensive Content” from “18+ (Adult Content)” since the definition of adult is not 18 in all countries, which caused confusion.Bug fixesThis release has a significant number of bug fixes. For the full list, check out the release notes.Statistics15 commits made in the master branch and six issues closed on the server repository.123 commits made in the master branch and thirty-four issues closed on the client repository.The 1.1.7 installers were downloaded more than 37,000 times since release in late June.",

                "title": "OpenBazaar at Scaling Bitcoin Conference in Milan", 
                "content": "by Chris Pacia   This month I had the opportunity to attend the third Scaling Bitcoin conference in Milan. My purpose for going was to stay on top of the latest developments in Bitcoin and keep an eye out for collaboration opportunities for OpenBazaar and OB1 related projects. Now that I’m back, I can give a review of sorts and talk about some of the cool ideas that were proposed and discussed. Firstly, the Scaling Bitcoin conferences seems to be evolving away from being exclusively about scaling and to a more general technical conference where bleeding edge ideas are presented. There were still a good number of presentations that were scaling-related, of course, but also a good mix of other ideas to improve Bitcoin. All of the presentations were of high quality, but I’ll comment on a few standouts.MimbleWimbleThe darling of the conference in my opinion, mimblewimble, was dropped on the internet by an anonymous mailing list poster as picked up by Andrew Poelstra and others. The basic idea is to use the same technology behind confidential transactions to turn blocks into a sort of big coinjoin transaction. Blockchain sleuths would not be able to use the transaction history to figure out who paid whom the way they can do today. A side benefit of this format is that much of the data in the blocks can be dropped allowing the blockchain to be compressed to a very small size. Possibly one downside is that transactions still need to be broadcasted to each node, meaning there is still an opportunity for active attackers to record all transactions and link transactions together. This attack could possibly be foiled by grouping transaction together before broadcasting. Most attendees I talked to about mimblewimble were very hot on it, but were holding back their enthusiasm until it could be demonstrated that it could scale (for example if they can make the lightning network work on it).TumbleBitI spent a good deal of time talking to Ethan Heilman who presented TumbleBit ― an anonymous coin mixer/payment hub. Whereas previous tumblers required users to trust the person running the tumbler to not keep logs which could de-anonymize users, TumbleBit makes that impossible through the clever use of cryptography. In addition to unlinkability, payments made through the tumbler would largely happen off chain. Over the years there has been some talk about building these type mixing protocol directly into wallets to encourage their use, improving fungibility and increasing the anonymity set, but we’ve seen little movement in that regard. Maybe going forward there will be an opportunity to collaborate and get TumbleBit–or something like it–into OpenBazaar. Ethan also offered to take a look at the OpenBazaar protocol to see if he can find ways to break it which, of course, would be great to have more eyes and more people with technical expertise reviewing it. It will only make the protocol stronger.     Notable MentionsIn the interest of time I’ll just offer a few more highlights:  I found Peter Todd’s talk about having miners skip validation and just focus on ordering, while requiring nodes to do their own validation to be an interesting rethinking of how consensus is achieved.  Emin Gun Sirer’s presentation on Bitcoin covenants was cool. People I spoke to about it liked the concept of covenants and suggested some ways of extending them further with Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees.  Side note: It was nice to seem movement on bip 150/151. I’ve been waiting for this for a long time.  I also had a short chat with Pierre who recently published a simulation of the FLARE routing for the lightning network. I talked to him about a routing simulator I wrote recently (which I didn’t publish since it was just a hack job to give me a rough idea of how well it would work). I think we both kind of agreed that there is still more work needed to optimizing routing and give us the greatest probability of finding routes from any one random node to another random node for a range of values. The routing needs to be very reliable for lightning to become widely used, in my opinion.  I had a really interesting chat with Mark Friedenbach from Blockstream about some of the advanced things they are working on. I won’t publish what they are as I don’t think they have made them public yet and I’ll let them talk about it when they’re ready, but they are super cool and at least one of the projects is something I’ve been wanting to work on myself and would probably be working on if I wasn’t working on OpenBazaar.  I spoke with Joseph and Laolu (Lightning Network) about collaborating on an SPV wallet implementation in Go. Tadge Dryja wrote a small (and incomplete) SPV library for their lightning network project which I forked and have done some work on to beef it up. There is still a good way to go though and I’m hoping we have the opportunity to work together to get a solid implementation for both of us to use.  I didn’t get to attend Roger Ver’s free speech party and was disappointed that it was held at the same time as the main reception. Both parties ended up smaller than they would have been and it reduced the opportunities to network. If it was scheduled as an after party, or better yet a party on Sunday night, I’m willing to bet most conference attendees would have gone. There were lots of people looking for a party on Sunday night but there wasn’t one scheduled! Maybe a missed opportunity.So all around the conference was very productive and it was good opportunity to make connections and stay on top of the latest developments. Assuming future Scaling Bitcoin conferences follow the same format I will be looking to attend them as well.",

I’ve never been to Prague, and hadn’t visited Paralelní Polis yet, so I was excited to attend. If you’re not familiar with Paralelní Polis, they’re an organization of hackers and artists in the Czech Republic who condemn authoritarian governments and use digital activism to make people more free. This year’s Hacker’s Congress described itself as having “hundreds of technology enthusiasts, tech-entrepreneurs, activists and cryptoanarchists to celebrate the age of digital freedom and decentralization!” You can’t miss the Paralelní Polis building in Prague; it’s completely black. The bottom floor is a coffee shop that only accepts Bitcoin, and the other floors were turned into rooms for presentations over the weekend.    I spoke on the last day about OpenBazaar. Here’s the summary of my talk:  Existing commerce online is centralized by a handful of companies who monitor data, censor trade, and use tightly controlled payment systems. OpenBazaar is an open source software project which creates a decentralized network for trade, using Bitcoin. Because OpenBazaar removes the middleman, there are no fees, there is no censorship, and there is no mass collection of data. This talk explains the project’s history, how it works technically, and how future changes will further enhance decentralization and censorship-resistance.I focused quite a bit on the improvements that are coming in the 2.0 version of OpenBazaar. The audience was great and asked lots of questions, and we ran out of time, but fortunately I was able to follow up a lot of conversations with people afterwards. [caption id=”attachment_1195” align=”aligncenter” width=”960”] Presenting OB at HCPP16[/caption] Immediately following my presentation was a talk by Justin Drake of Duo Money, the company behind the OpenBazaar search engine Duo Search. Justin’s talk was about being an entrepreneur on OpenBazaar:  OpenBazaar is an open-innovation decentralised protocol for trade. Unlike proprietary marketplaces like eBay or AirBnb it presents many opportunities for entrepreneurs to build upon. Justin will give an overview of the fledging OpenBazaar ecosystem, focusing on the opportunities and challenges for entrepreneurs.He talked about his experience building Duo Money, which originally was meant to be a payment and HTTP gateway to the OpenBazaar network, but that plan was dashed when they lost their banking partner - only days before OB launched! They quickly pivoted to building a search engine, and only weeks later launched Duo Search. He made the point that relying on permissioned systems like banks stifles innovation, but building on an open system like OB or Bitcoin allows for permissionless innovation. Justin also gave tips for people looking to build in the OB ecosystem, as well as giving business ideas for aspiring entrepreneurs as well, both of which he turned into blog posts. [caption id=”attachment_1197” align=”aligncenter” width=”648”] Justin Drake of Duo Money Presenting at HCPP16[/caption]   HCPP16 was a great place to meet with people and talk about all different types of new decentralization technologies, and quite a few people had ideas on how their project and OpenBazaar could compliment each other. I highly recommend that anyone who is interested in decentralization technology, and using new tech in order to make people more free, should learn more about Paralelní Polis and attend next year’s Hacker’s Congress. After the conference I was able to do some Prague sightseeing. It’s a beautiful city. I enjoyed my trip to HCPP16 and Prague, and hope to attend next year. ",

Today our featured shop is Stone Banana, a one-of-a-kind custom apparel shop featuring great custom artwork! You can find Stone Banana on OpenBazaar, on Duosearch and at StoneBanana.com  Tell us a bit about yourself? I’m a psych/neuroscience lab manager at Purdue by day (sanghalab.com) and an aspiring entrepreneur by night. It was less than a year ago that I realized I wanted to create my own business. Artistic design has always been an interest of mine, and I had sort of stumbled into t-shirt design around the same time I became interested in starting a business. So, Stone Banana became my first go at it! What do you make? Stone Banana makes graphic tees. I create the designs, sometimes starting from scratch, sometimes from my other artwork, and sometimes from the photography of others (with their permission :)) I have some other products that I’m currently designing, and hope to use the profits from t-shirts to bring these to market. Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? I use OpenBazaar because I love bitcoin and am super excited to participate in a truly open-source market. I’ve done a bit of cryptocurrency mining/trading in the past, but I never felt like I was bringing bitcoin any closer to being mainstream. Not being a coder, participating in OpenBazaar has been a way for me to help advance not only bitcoin, but the idea of truly peer-to-peer markets. (Beyond just talking to my friends and family about it!) How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? It’s been great! Of course I’m very excited for 2.0 and the features that come with it, but 1.0 has done the job of providing a fee-free trading platform that’s allowed my shop to be discovered as well as to complete many transactions successfully! How familiar are you with Bitcoin? Fairly familiar. I’ve done a good bit of reading and watching Andreas (among others :)) speak on the topic over the last 3 years. I’ve done some mining and trading, and pretty much been an advocate since I first found out about it! But, I’ve never actually bought anything besides other currencies and cloud mining until OpenBazaar! What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you? I think the main thing for me right now would be an improved product upload interface, as well as selector options within each product such as size, color etc. What products/promos are you featuring this season? I have a great new design in my shop for Halloween! We’ll also be doing a 10% discount through October–then stay connected to see what I’ll be doing for Bitcoin Black Friday!",

                "content": "By: Dr. Washington Sanchez Co-founder of OB1; core-developer for OpenBazaarSince the early days of OpenBazaar, I’ve been interested in the potential for it to be used for dropshipping. But first, a quick intro:  Dropshipping is the process of selling goods to customers by placing orders on their behalf to suppliers, who ship the good directly to the customer.Dropshipping has several advantages for individuals who want to start their own side-business:  Straightforward. I won’t say it’s easy, but it is certainly far less complex and cheaper than importing and housing stock, let alone packaging and shipping to customers. Dropshipping enables you to focus that energy on sales and marketing.  Flexible. You can sell a handful of products, or you can sell hundreds or thousands. It’s up to you. Running an online ecommerce store, dropshipping goods all around the world, can be done at home or in a cafe. As a side business, it doesn’t occupy too much of your time. If the business starts to scale up quickly, you can find yourself quitting your job and becoming your own boss sooner than you think!  Low entry costs. This really can’t be emphasized enough. The costs of setting up a dropshipping operation can be done with very little capital up front. Also purchasing stock is only triggered when a customer has made a purchase: positive cash flow!  [caption id=”attachment_1154” align=”aligncenter” width=”800”] Example of a store I run that dropships items from Aliexpress[/caption]   Even though the barriers to entry in running a dropshipping ecommerce store are low, make no mistake that it’s hard work to make it both great and scalable.Unique ValueNow, what’s to stop the customer approaching the supplier directly and purchasing these goods? Well, nothing. This is why some dropshippers go to great lengths to hide their suppliers from potential customers. A far better approach is to offer unique value in one way or another:  Niche. Focus on a niche class of goods or services so that your store becomes a lens for customers to find what they want.

This kinda reverses everything I’ve said about dropshipping so far, but if you can get your hands on the product before it reaches the customer (i.e. it’s a local sale, time isn’t a big factor, or it’s a popular product you can stock a little of), then add a unique brand or feature to an otherwise generic product. This immediately differentiates your products from everything else; you may even be shocked how a $2 modification can add to the retail value.[caption id=”attachment_1157” align=”aligncenter” width=”800”] JDS Personalized Gifts are an example of a wholesaler that sells customizable stock… perfect for branding.[/caption] Dropshipping is both an art and a science, and there are plenty of resources you can draw from to become really great at it. Shopify has a great guide available for free that you can use for existing stores as well as OpenBazaar!Dropshipping with Bitcoin and OpenBazaarAs you can imagine, dropshipping is a low margin business, but profitable under the right circumstances. It is particularly attractive to the Bitcoin ecosystem for 2 reasons:  Arbitrage. Dropshippers can take advantage of the rising value of Bitcoin, which is expected to be an upward secular trend for the true believers! As a result, they can order the good from the supplier with fiat and sell the good to the customer for Bitcoin. The price can be at a significant discount if the Vendor expects that the price of Bitcoin will rise to exceed the initial losses they experience on the transaction (i.e. it’s a time-preference thing). The price volatility of Bitcoin is a two-edged sword, so tread carefully if you apply these discounts.  Supply. Bitcoin is money, but it doesn’t have the chance to become the dominant international currency unless it can be used to buy anything (at least off the Internet). Bitcoin-powered dropshippers can make a meaningful impact to the ecosystem by offering a greater supply of goods and services that can be purchased with Bitcoin.  [caption id=”attachment_1158” align=”aligncenter” width=”600”] My definition of success for Bitcoin[/caption]  My definition of success for BitcoinDropshipping on OpenBazaar is straightforward. Personally, I run several stores selling a variety of goods that I dropship predominantly from Aliexpress. Since April of this year, I’ve made ~40 sales, which isn’t too bad when you consider that I run these stores after-hours. Here’s how I do it:  Create your OpenBazaar node. For now, you’ll probably need to run your node on a VPS so that it is accessible 24/7, unless you have a desktop computer that’s always on. (Note: Later this month we will be sharing a very easy method for setting this up and will post again when it is live!) If you’re running a blog or web-facing ecommerce store on an existing VPS, you can easily install and run OpenBazaar side-by-side. There’s a great YouTube playlist with step-by-step instructions. Alternatively you can opt for hosted solutions that will set it up on your behalf.  Setup your store. Create an eye-catching avatar/logo and header. Fill out your About page to pitch your store; a gif or two always helps. Add your email address or social media accounts, which can help foster trust. Register a Blockchain ID, and add your OpenBazaar GUID to your new decentralized identity as well as your other accounts.  [caption id=”attachment_1159” align=”aligncenter” width=”800”] I bought the logo and header off a digital artist on OpenBazaar incidentally![/caption]    Choose your niche. I recommend tailoring your store according to a specific niche or product category. This helps you narrow down on a group of suppliers, helps you build a brand, and increases your chances of repeat business.  Choose your suppliers. Suppliers can be another ecommerce store or an entire platform. Personally, I love to use AliExpress because it has a huge range of products of different categories, free shipping, and cheap prices. Moreover, AliExpress let’s you sort listings in a category/subcategory according to the number of orders (i.e. sort by popularity). This allows you to select items that have a proven track-record of market demand. You can also target popular and reputable suppliers on AliExpress to dropship.  [caption id=”attachment_1160” align=”aligncenter” width=”648”] You can pick the top 20 most popular items to sell within a product category or niche on AliExpress.[/caption]    Optimize your listing. Product information is your friend; the more data you add to your listing description about the product, the better! I generally only set 1 image per listing to minimize the contract download time for the Buyer. In the Description section, I include as many html  tags as I need for additional product images.  Follow everyone and be friendly. A good way to get attention is to follow other nodes on OpenBazaar and send them a short ‘hello’. Buy some items off their stores and make friends.  Social media. Use social media to advertise what you’re selling on OpenBazaar. Product listings from https://duosear.ch include the listing image when shared on social media sites! OpenBazaar 2.0   As we previously announced, OpenBazaar 2.0 will be a paradigm shift for the protocol and the project. It more closely aligns with the functionality we envisioned in the early days of the project, as well as fixing a number of limitations we’ve been longing to address:  Distributed content. Store and listing data will be hosted in a distributed manner between peers on the network. What this means is that a Vendor won’t need to run their node off a desktop computer or VPS 24/7. Individuals can contribute to the health of the network by running a Gateway node, hosting store content on behalf of other users (which may serve as the foundation of affiliate marketing rewards with Bitcoin).  Web accessibility. Stores and their listings will be accessible to the web via Gateways, making it that much easier to discover and purchase anything from the OpenBazaar network.  Easier installation. We expect significantly less technical issues with the installation of OpenBazaar 2.0 across all the major operating systems.  Flexibility. Vendors will have greater control to create product options and shipping rules for physical listings. Digital content can also be automatically download after purchasing.This is only a snapshot of the many changes we’re bringing to OpenBazaar, which will make it that much easier to start-up a dropshipping enterprise on the network for free, with zero restrictions!",

Today our featured shop is Coffee Milk Syrup and it’s pretty much what it sounds like, shop owner Adana makes her own “coffee syrup” that’s like chocolate syrup—just made with coffee! You can find Coffee Milk Syrup on OpenBazaar, on Duosearch and at CoffeeMilkSyrup.cf      Tell us a bit about yourself? I make coffee syrup during the day, and I’m a writer, and a web developer at night. I’m originally from Houston, TX, though I’m currently living in Dallas. What do you make? I make Some Awesome Coffee Syrup. It’s similar to chocolate syrup, but it’s made with coffee, so it makes everything taste like coffee. Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? I work from home, and getting your product or service out there is hard to do sometimes. I saw OpenBazaar as a way to put myself into a market that would likely appreciate that, and that I was in full control of. I was originally with OpenBazaar when you guys first launched, and I joined in and made a quick store, and within just a few days I had my first sell. With the products that I make and sell, It’s hard to get customers without doing a lot of actual footwork: going to stores, food trucks, and vendors alike, locally. That also limited me on how I was able to sell my product and I think OpenBazaar is exactly where I need to be to get my big start with Coffee Syrup. How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? My experience has been great. I am in the Slack community for OpenBazaar and the admin, vendors, and people in general are very helpful and polite. I’ve had questions ranging from “How would I setup my name properly” all the way to “how do I migrate my OB server from Windows to Linux” and I’ve had all of my questions answered thoroughly. The community for OpenBazaar is full of great people. How familiar are you with Bitcoin? Quite familiar with it. I have traded across the exchanges and used bitcoin locally to buy food, or books even. I like the usability of it and of course bitcoin contracts are amazing for vendors like myself. What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you? I think that implementing a similar system to “Reviews” would be nice, but have it be something along the lines of “Store Updates,” similar to “News” I suppose. This way, when a store are preparing to put items on sale, say for the Black Friday event, the customers or people that come to the store would be able to know about the sale, through looking at the updates/news tab. This would help keep the customers in the know about products. If I only had a limited amount of items, I could make a post about how it has a limited inventory and how long the sale would last. It would help with customer questions. Any scheduled downtime could be listed there as well, as about once a week, I take my store offline for about 3-4 hours for system updates.",

Today we interview Kyle from the band Myco, which released their new EP exclusively on OpenBazaar for the first week. You can find the Myco store on OpenBazaar, and on Duosearch as well.  Tell us a bit about yourself?    My name is Kyle Henry, I’m from Kansas City and started Myco in 2015 after moving back to Kansas City from Hong Kong, where I lived between 2013 and 2015 and taught English as my primary job. Before moving to Hong Kong I studied botany and mycology and discovered how amazing fungus really is. It is essentially the backbone of ecological systems on land and acts as a decentralized network or internet for organisms on the earth. Plants and fungus form symbiotic relationships and communicate through these fungal networks. A few years later after I had begun my scientific studies I got involved with bitcoin in 2011 when I started mining them with my GPU. The next year it became pretty much impossible to do so, but I mined about 15 before that happened. While in Hong Kong I continued promoting and using bitcoin and talking to Hong Kong natives about it where ever I went. I found that many people in the tech field there were already aware of bitcoin but most weren’t involved in it. While living there I used bitcoin to transfer money between my bank accounts in the US and Hong Kong. Instead of paying ridiculous fees to do such a thing through my bank I used exchanges and often made a profit when transferring funds. I ended up moving back to Kansas city in 2015 and started on my project. I’ve been a musician since I was about 14 and I had never officially released anything but music is my passion so I set out to make a project that embodied my beliefs of everything being interconnected and how decentralization and specifically blockchain technology can free us from our slavery.  After writing and recording everything I set out to find band members to play live shows and I’ve gone through many members but eventually asked a good friend of mine Andrew MacIntyre to play drums for me. Then I found an amazing guitarist named Jesse Rodriguez and a bassist named Cory Yeager online who have helped me complete this project.  The first song we released is called “Myceliated” and is essentially about fungus and the effect it has on the universe and the human experience as well as decentralization and how bitcoin can end wars. We released this single with a bitcoin qr code on the cover and had a tremendous response from the bitcoin community. We also put a digital download of this song on OpenBazaar once OpenBazaar went public. Months later after a lot of practice the band is ready to start playing shows and we decided to release our debut 5 song EP exclusively on OpenBazaar on September 22 2016 to show our support for decentralization and freedom. The self titled EP will be released globally on most music platforms in fiat currencies on September 26 2016, but we prefer being paid directly in bitcoin.   What do you make / sell?  Original psychedelic rock music. Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? We want to support innovative platforms that make free trade and liberty possible in this ever increasing statist world. How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? Openbazaar and it’s community has been great to us so far, we have heard nothing but praise from those who have purchased our music and if we have need help with setting anything up or doing anything on OpenBazaar there has always been incredibly helpful people. What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you? I would love to see a feature that allows us to setup a digital download automatically so we don’t have to manually enter everything for every single order. Also, I think it would be great if there were anonymity features built in for other users.. this I believe would push OpenBazaar into the mainstream as it would allow for free trade without the worry of government locking you in a cage. Anything else you’d like to say? My favorite author Aldous Huxley once said in the foreword of his book Brave New World “Only a large-scale popular movement toward decentralization and self-help can arrest the present tendency toward statism” When he wrote this in 1932 there was no such movement but now with bitcoin and blockchain technology we have such a movement. Our goal is to spread the message of freedom through decentralization and push the movement further into the mainstream.",

                "content": "Front EndMany new features and changes were made for upcoming 1.1.8 release. Significant changes:  Added the ability for sellers to pin listings, so that they appear first in their store.  Added the ability for sellers to set a Maximum Quantity to listings. Buyers can’t buy more than that number in a single order.  If the Maximum Quantity is set to zero, the listing will still be visible, but cannot be purchased. This allows sellers to have listings that are “out of stock” or “coming soon”.  Added the ability for sellers to set listings to “hidden”. Hidden listings will not appear in the store tab of their page when other users look at the page (the owner can still see the hidden listings).  If a user enters the address of the hidden listing in the address bar, they can still see and purchase it. This allows for private listings [note that the client will not display listings with a “hidden” flag to people using the client, but third parties crawling nodes can still see the listings].  Addresses are now more flexible. The street, state/territory/region and postal code fields are all optional, and a contact field has been added, where buyers can add information like an email address or phone number.   Changed stores to list the most recently saved listings first, after pinned listings [frequently requested by vendors].[caption id=”attachment_1111” align=”aligncenter” width=”648”] New listing features shown in red[/caption] Minor changes:  Uploaded photos for listings will now auto-rotate based on their EXIF data. Photos that are sideways due to being taken on a mobile device will not have the correct orientation.  A bug was fixed with the review stars that caused fraction in the reviews to add an extra star.  Timezones were removed, they were intended for features that turned out not to be needed.  The list of shippable countries was removed from the purchase modal. That information is shown in the main listing page under the shipping tab.  If a buyer looks at a listing page and has no saved addresses, the section of the page that shows shippable countries will instead show a message that the user does not yet have any saved addresses.  When changing servers, the client will load the last page that specific server was on. That removes the issue where when changing servers the new server would try to load the page the previous server “remembered”.Back EndCurrent versionAdded multiple new features for upcoming 1.1.8 release.  Added “pinned” flag to listing contracts, allowing vendors to pin favored listings and have them displayed at the top of their store.  Added max quantity to listing contracts, allowing vendors to set a maximum quantity a buyer can purchase during a sale.  Added a “hidden” flag to listing contracts, allowing vendors to make certain listings visible or invisible to buyers [note that the client will not display listings with a “hidden” flag, but third parties crawling nodes will still see the listings].  Added an optional alternative contact field to give buyers and sellers the ability to give each other more relevant contact information easily.2.0Developer Chris Pacia got a 2.0 OpenBazaar node running over Tor earlier this week, having made the necessary adjustments to IPFS to allow Tor traffic. This is still early and needs more work, but it appears likely that OpenBazaar 2.0 will be able to use Tor.

                "title": "Can Bitcoin and Multisig Reduce Identity Theft and Fraud?", 
                "content": "Identity theft and ecommerce fraud are costing billions of dollars each year, and have been increasing in recent years. Fortunately, due to the technical design of Bitcoin - along with one of its most powerful features, multisig – both buyers and sellers online have alternatives that can reduce the likelihood of being involved in identity theft or fraud. In the United States, an estimated 17.6 million people were victims of identity theft in 2014 (the most recent year numbers are available).  The most common types of misused information were bank accounts (38% of cases) and credit cards (42% of cases). It isn’t surprising that millions of cases of identity theft occur each year based on bank accounts and credit cards. The numbers that allow access to those accounts are unchanging, they are tied directly to your identity, and they are being stored in databases by any number of retailers who you’ve done business with. Those databases are a treasure trove for cybercriminals, and they are constantly under attack. The list of high-profile breaches in recent years is impressive: 56 million credit cards in 2014 by Home Depot, 70 million in 2013 by Target, 76 million households in the summer of 2014 by JP Morgan Chase, and the list goes on and on. Bitcoin works differently. The numbers that give you access to your bitcoins aren’t shared publicly, and they don’t make their way into any databases. You don’t need to trust a business to store your Bitcoin information properly like you would a credit card – the business doesn’t have any information to store. There are no treasure troves of data for cybercriminals to steal. Your bitcoin also aren’t tied directly to your identity. You can choose to give the merchant as much or as little information about yourself as you want. This gives buyers some assurances that their purchases won’t increase the likelihood of identity theft, and it gives merchants one less piece of data they need to protect. Identity theft based on bitcoin transactions is practically impossible. People are starting to notice Bitcoin’s potential for reducing identity theft. In April, Business Wire reported that a recent survey showed victims of identity theft were taking action to prevent it from happening again, and 10% of them were using alternative currencies like Bitcoin.MultisigThere is another aspect to Bitcoin that helps prevent online fraud. A feature called multisignature – often shortened to multisig – allows for bitcoins within a certain address to be controlled by more than one person. The majority of bitcoins are owned by individuals, just like cash and other forms of money. With multisig you can now have multiple people, or even organizations, control the same coins. The multiple parties must then come to agreement before the bitcoins can be moved out of the account. There are many applications for multisig including increased security of funds, more equitable control of funds in non-profits and other organizations, and the ability to create complex contracting systems. Perhaps the most useful application of multisig is escrow. A common use is the two-of-three multisig. This means there are three parties involved, and any two of them must agree before the bitcoins can be moved from escrow. The buyer and seller both choose a third party they trust, and then the buyer sends the funds into multisig. If the seller delivers as promised, then the buyer and seller both agree to release the funds, and since only two out of three parties are needed, the funds are then released from escrow. If there’s a dispute and buyer and seller can’t come to an agreement, then the third party is brought in to determine the winning party and join with them to release funds. Consider how this is different from the existing system. In the current system with a stolen credit card, a buyer can order something and the seller will ship it as normal. When the real owner of the credit card realizes this and the credit card company reverses the transaction, the vendor typically is forced to eat the cost of their product. Stolen credit cards aren’t the only way fraud is accomplished. Buyers can claim no delivery even when they’ve received a product. Ecommerce platforms and credit card companies are notorious for siding with buyers over vendors, and often don’t do their due diligence to determine who is really at fault. Vendors can also defraud buyers too, taking money but not delivering or delivering inferior products. Bitcoin, along with multisig, prevents much of this fraud from occurring. There is no credit card company controlling Bitcoin that can reverse transactions, giving vendors the assurance that they control their own money. There’s also the ability for buyers and sellers to come to agreement about who will provide their dispute resolution via multisig, instead of being forced to use the ecommerce platform itself. As long as both parties choose a reputable third party, there’s little chance that fraud will be successful. Bitcoin and multisig are useful tools to prevent fraud, but they’re not perfect. Bitcoins can be stolen, and once taken they’re unlikely to ever be returned. Protecting them takes some technical knowledge and the learning curve can be steeper than other payment systems. Although Bitcoin isn’t perfect and won’t eliminate all fraud online, it’s a powerful alternative for those willing to use them.OpenBazaarGiving buyers and sellers the ability to prevent fraud is one of many reasons OpenBazaar relies completely on Bitcoin. OpenBazaar also has two-of-three multisig built in, with an open marketplace of moderators who offer dispute resolution. If you want more privacy in online trade, with no fees, no censorship, and better protection from fraud, try OpenBazaar now.",

Today we interview a vendor selling store hosting, Space for eCommerce, who has been connected to the OpenBazaar community since the beginning! You can find Space for eCommerce on OpenBazaar at @storefore/store, on Duosearch here and on their own website at spacefore.com  Tell us a bit about yourself? Brian Dunbar - husband, father of five, Catholic, IT professional since 1990. The majority of my career I’ve been a systems administrator: making sure servers are up and pumping out bits. Systems administration is a speciality that rewards attention to detail and obsessive nitpicking, and I do pretty good with it. I no longer recall how I heard about OpenBazaar. I had a few days of downtime over the Thanksgiving holiday in 2015. I installed the prototype, played around with testnet. That software, the constant and excellent progress, the folks working for OB1, and the investment they’d attracted, convinced me that OpenBazaar has real potential. Like this;  The last thirty years have demonstrated that cheap, de-centralized and open will beat closed, centralized and expensive.          There used to be a plethora of network protocols - ways of connecting computers. Token Ring, ARCNet, and many others. Ethernet came along and was (then) inferior to everything else on the market. It was cheap. It was not owned by IBM: anyone could build an ethernet network card. Now, ‘ethernet’ is synonymous with ‘network’. Nobody uses anything else.      CompuServe, BIX, AOL, DELPHI, Prodigy used to be ‘the’ way to go online - you paid up each month, logged into a walled garden and did your thing with the community. The world wide web came along and … they are no more.      Examples are legion, I need not belabor the point. They have one thing in common. They were closed and expensive and are now in the museum next to the apatosaurus skeleton. OpenBazaar is cheap, decentralized and open. The lesson is clear. What do you make? I provide managed hosting for open bazaar stores. I’ll keep the stores running, backup on a regular basis, update when required, and whatever fiddly bits are needed to keep the store online and visible. My market are shop owners, business guys, regular folks who want to sell their goods, and leave the ‘IT stuff’ to the professionals. Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? It is, basically, a space that is under-serviced by guys like me. Market opportunity! I hope to become one of the go-to guys for hosting, and leverage that into other services in the OB space. How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? Pretty good, thanks for asking. There are issues - but there are always issues with software, and the OB1 team is kicking ass on bugs. And they’re busy in active development for OpenBazaar 2. I’ve taken it for a spin and it’s going to be a tremendous improvement on the current Open Bazaar. How familiar are you with Bitcoin? I’d heard of Bitcoin but prior to last year I’d never done anything with Bitcoin. Which is odd, I suppose, because politically I’m Anarcho-Capitalist. I should be thinking about it night, and day. What can I say - I’m a busy guy. It simply hadn’t come up. Now .. I’ve got a side project for getting involved with bitcoin mining, and I’m plotting how to get a zcash mining farm up and going … it’s a good life, if you don’t falter. What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you? I have a few suggestions. All of them will have to be addressed in order for OpenBazaar to be useful in the long run.  Multiple Users and roles          Eventually, an actual business with multiple users is going to use OpenBazaar. Those guys operate with multiple people, who have different roles. They’ll demand accountability, and role separation. This isn’t just those guys being anal, but in many cases required by law or auditors.        Credentials          The credentials are in plain-text configuration file, which value is stored in a database. This works, and it’s reasonably secure. I understand why it’s that way. But we can do better!        Failover          I want to put a load balancer in front of an OpenBazaar store, running on multiple servers. Downtime for one server does not mean downtime for the store.      ",

                "content": "In these posts we take a look at some unique members of the OpenBazaar ecosystem. Today we interview a vendor – Print It! – selling items that he 3d prints himself, as well as a 3d printing service. You can find his store on OpenBazaar at @print_it, and on Duosearch here. I’ve personally bought a few items from the Print It! shop, the most recent being an OpenBazaar tent, of which 50% of his profit he donates back to the project. [caption id=”attachment_1063” align=”aligncenter” width=”648”] OpenBazaar Tent from Print It! store[/caption] Tell us a bit about yourself? As many in our community I’m an inquisitive person and very excited about our culture and with it our technical evolution. I’m happy of being a part and a contemporary witness of this development where people get the chance to express their true nature and explore their full potential in a growing free society. What do you make / sell? In my eyes my main product is the 3D printing service. Everyone who invests some hours on tutorials about CAD software, will be surprised how easy it is to bring an abstract idea into a digital shape. The next logical step would be to convert that digital shape into an analog one. The digital step is free to go thanks to people who are developing amazingly complex, but easy to use CAD tools like Blender for example. The second step unfortunately isn’t free at all. If you’re not a designer who’s testing several prototypes, you’ll think more than twice about buying a 3D printer. Especially if you’re keen on highest quality and accuracy, and don’t want to be limited by a cheap printer, which only produces frustration. The other products in my shop have two main goals: To provide useful tools or gadgets and to help people getting in touch with 3D printing. They can also be seen as a demonstration of whats possible with such a diverse usable technique. Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? The steady and fast growing community of makers have shown that there is so much more potential in our society. More and more people are realizing that they can accomplish more than just following the mainstream by consuming products which are dictated by fancy advertisements. Everything can be improved forever, by everyone. It just needs someone who is curious enough to think around the corner. Openbazaar itself is a great example. When I first started modeling prototypes and finally got the chance to buy a high quality 3D printer, I asked myself, why not sharing this opportunity with everyone else who is interested in converting their ideas into real models or gadgets? [caption id=”attachment_1065” align=”aligncenter” width=”648”] Print It! OpenBazaar storefront[/caption] How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? When I used OpenBazaar the first time, I was amazed how professional everything looked and how easy it was to set up a simple but nicely designed shop. It’s more than obvious that the OB1 team did a really great job on it. And the best thing is that implementing and supporting a very social and equal structure is one of their main goals. It’s a great community in every way and just nice to help other people or receive help from others. How familiar are you with Bitcoin? I’m using Bitcoin since 2013 and realized very soon, that the best thing that can happen to a cryptocurrency is just being used as a currency. This whole speculation thing is not creating a real value. OpenBazaar hopefully will be a huge help for bitcoin to achieve its real purpose. What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more usefulfor you? The main steps to improve this already awesome app would be the implementation of IPFS and Tor. But as far as I know you’re already working on this. Although I sell legal stuff, I’d like to see the option to delete fulfilled orders or at least the addresses of buyers. When tor hopefully gets implemented this would be a very important thing to protect the privacy of buyers. Another thing would be a solution to the problem, that a lot of bitcoins get lost in escrow when the buyer forgets to finalize the order and the chosen mod isn’t reachable either. Maybe a deadline would be nice to release the funds, when there is no response from the buyer and the mod anymore. Another wish would be, that the step from OB 1.0 to OB 2.0 wont result in a “reset” of every shop in the aspect of followers and reviews. I think I speak for every vendor on OpenBazaar that good reviews and many followers are a result of hard work, in which case it would be a pity to loose them all. Anything else you’d like to say? I’d like to thank everyone in the community and OB-Team making all this possible whats just happening right now. Special thanks to @sampatt for being this careful and interested in everyone’s opinion!",

                "content": "In these posts we take a look at some unique members of the OpenBazaar ecosystem. Today we interview a vendor - Virus Media - selling various items, among them handmade crocheted items. You can find Virus Media on OpenBazaar at @virusmedia, and on Duosearch here.    Tell us a bit about yourself? First and foremost, virus media is a family operation. My brother and I, along with our families (11 of us altogether), feel that even though alternative media has been exploding these past few years, which has benefited everyone, alt media shouldn’t strive to just replace the corporate media. Instead it should seek to innovate and educate to the point that the very idea people get in their heads when they hear the word “media” is something completely different than today. If I could sum up our vision for the future in a word, it’s “decentralize.” As cliche as that might sound right now, we think that there is so much more work that can be done in this area, and OpenBazaar is at the tip of the spear. We’re slowly working toward this ideal ourselves, while we’re in this creation and brainstorming phase, we decided to get a headstart on one of the major problems all media faces, no matter the size of the group, funding. We, like so many others recently, believe that “ads” are not the way of the future. We believe a multi-faceted approach that brings even more value to the reader is the way to go. OpenBazaar is a perfect example of what one of those facets could (should) be for the decentralized media of the future. What do you make? Our goal is to tap each family member’s natural skills and passions that could bring value to other people’s lives. Currently moderation services and textiles have taken the front seat and we are looking to expand our offering of all natural beeswax and essential oil based products. Fun fact, we now source our beeswax from another OpenBazaar vendor, PexPeppers. In the near future we plan on adding leather products and a number of privacy protecting tech products and services.  Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? We want to encourage transacting in bitcoin, we see it as a matter of conscience. We want to be an example others can follow. Second, we can easily see our media operation ruffling feathers in the future and we want to do what we can to protect our supply lines from bad actors. We all know what happened to wikileaks, but countless other alt media outlets with less of a voice have suffered the same. Third, it’s FUN! Rediscovering the bazaars of old with a modern twist has brought a whole new level of enjoyment from making and spending money. How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? We’re proud to be part of this pioneering effort! The community has been great, the developers have been gracious and we’ve been having a blast using the chat feature. The way the chat feature has been implemented really makes you feel as if you’re walking into someone’s shop. We’ve met some old friends and made a good many new ones! ProTip: Talk up vendors with the chat feature, you’ll often find hidden products or discounts! How familiar are you with Bitcoin? One of the things that has slowed our progress is that we all still have our day jobs, for now. Nevertheless, we have been receiving 100% of our wages in bitcoin for a good year and a half. So the entire family has become intimately acquainted with bitcoin during this time. It’s been our most liberating move as of yet. Keep an eye out, one of our first articles, or series of articles, will be an in depth look at how to live 100% on bitcoin. When we become fully operational, you’ll be able to find us on steem, yours network, watchmybit and popchest (when they get out of their startup accelerator) and search for us with goodgopher or duckduckgo. Our website will be hosted on IPFS and will mirror a lot of the content. Until then, I suggest you look into each of those cryptocurrency based technologies and services and start using them, so you’ll be ready for our first articles! What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you? First, the amount of features available already completely blew me away, what OpenBazaar has already accomplished is impressive. As a developer myself, I think I have a little more insight into what it takes to pull something like this off. I also know that the feature request list for e-commerce sites is literally never ending. My day job is customizing e-commerce solutions to the visions of the creatives. It is a tough job! That being said, yes, I do have a list. ;-)1. Inventory Management2. Promo Codes (discount, free shipping, buy x get y, etc)3. Custom CSS4. xpub key import for refund and vendor receive addresses5.

She loved the old advertisements pic.twitter.com/DfzaNaShVV  — Sam Patterson (@SamuelPatt) April 12, 2016Tell us a bit about yourself? Crypto Collectibles was actually started over two years ago through a merchant hosting site Moolah.io, accepting payments for comic books in Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin, while having a sister store open on Etsy for products that fit into their ‘antique’ rule, being 20 years or older.  History was not kind to Moolah.io unfortunately for myself and all other stores that were using the hosting services, so comics were limited to being sold on Etsy for the past couple of years. What do you sell? Mostly comic books at the moment, but general geek merchandise, promotional items, and or collectibles of any sort is up for sale. [caption id=”attachment_1028” align=”aligncenter” width=”1074”] Snapshot from his Duosear.ch page[/caption] Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? Multiple reasons, supporting crypto, supporting meaningful new tech, and of course no listing fees with maximum possible audience. How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far? Rough moments, but mostly good.   I feel slightly more comfortable in a Linux environment, that is a weird bonus that has come from this experience as an early adopter that I think users who are jumping on to OpenBazaar now will never have to worry about dealing with.  It is their loss, but the point and click ease that we all desire a Bitcoin app would have where it is so easy anyone can do it, is just around the corner with OpenBazaar.   My experience from using OpenBazaar from day one until now has shown OB1 devs are working every single day, there is a ton of other people into Bitcoin who can code who are helping the OB1 devs, every issue seems to be being addressed directly now or is on the roadmap. How familiar are you with Bitcoin? Fairly to very. What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you? Stability. Little tweaks here and there, the little additions.  An example for me would be multiple items can be combined and have just one shipping cost. ** Anything else you’d like to say?** Best of luck to any new stores being created.  To those who have tried OpenBazaar in the past but was there in the first month of release when things were a little borked, give it a spin again, check out DuoSear.ch or Bazaar Hound the mobile app, make a purchase, be forgiving as an early adopter of something new, tell a friend, support crypto.",

                "content": "Update, February 13, 2018: In an effort to consolidate all the existing donation funds into one place, we’ve created a new address with the same characteristics as below. The QR code and donation address below have both been updated to the most recent address. Back in November 2014 we created a 2-of-4 multisig account for our OpenBazaar project fund, where we could receive donations. We explained our reasoning for using multisig and being transparent with our project funds. That multisig account has four keyholders: Brian Hoffman, Sam Patterson, Washington Sanchez, and Dionysis Zindros. Dionysis has been instrumental in OpenBazaar’s creation and a strong supporter of the project, but hasn’t played an active role on the project recently. Also, the original setup of the multisig requires us to manually craft new transactions for each expenditure. In order for the project funds to be kept with active participants in the project, and for us to be able to pay out of the account more easily (important as the project grows), we are shifting the project funds to a new 2-of-3 multisig. The new multisig address (updated on Februrary 12, 2018) is 3EN8kP3yW9MGvyiRMtGqKavQ9wYg4BspzR, and here is the QR code:      We’re publicly tracking project fund expenditures. We haven’t used the fund often in recent times, but we expect now that OpenBazaar is launched it will happen more frequently, especially since merchandise sales began. We’re committed to transparency and will ensure that payments made out of the project fund will have the details noted. All sales of merchandise on the @OpenBazaar store will go directly into this fund, and reimbursements for shipping costs and purchasing the merchandise from vendors will then be made. We’ll try as much as possible to use vendors that accept Bitcoin. The same is true for bug bounties, maintaining server infrastructure, conference costs, and other expenses. They will all come out of this fund, with the preference of paying Bitcoin directly but using reimbursement if necessary.

This release includes several new features, including email notifications, multiple server management, CSV export for order management, and improved display of listing information.Email notificationsUsers can now enter the details of an SMTP server in Settings &gt; Advanced, and the server will connect to it to send email notifications about their OpenBazaar store. This feature is still early in development; users will need to have knowledge of their SMTP server to get this working, and the emails received are very simple. We will be making email notification easier to use in future releases, and the email notifications themselves will be more robust (we welcome help on improving this feature).    [caption id=”attachment_986” align=”aligncenter” width=”826”] Example email when an OB store receives an order[/caption]  Server managementPrevious releases made it difficult to use a single client to switch between multiple servers. The new release greatly simplifies this process by saving server information and allowing switching within the same client. This video shows this new feature being used.  CSV exportStores with a large number of products or orders need the ability to take data from their store and use it outside the client. We’ve added the ability to export this data into a CSV file. When viewing your transactions, click the Export CSV button to see the options.   Listing informationListings now have more information about them available when viewing them in the Discover section. New listings created will now have a tag in the top right corner which shows the type of listing they are: Physical, Digital, or a Service.

This only applies to listings made since the server was updated with the code to show this data.  basic information about your transactions can be exported to CSV from the transactions page  follower data on your store page is now lazy loaded, which should dramatically improve performance for stores with many followers.  chats with unread messages are positioned at the top of your chat list  the local node is only started if the client is currently set to connect to it  the shortcuts were changed to avoid colliding with common system shortcut keys. The reload the app shortcut is now ‘f’, and refresh the current view is ‘r’.  you can add and remove a user as a moderator for your store from their user page.  Bitcoin prices are now formatted according to the language of the user.  a bug in the link for a listing in the transaction modal was fixed.  you can no longer attempt to purchase your own listings (the final step in the purchase flow is not clickable)​ ​Special thanks to our contributors for code submissions to this release: ​ - Dekker3D - dsmurrell - mariodian ​ And special thanks to everyone that contributed to translations on Transifex (https://www.transifex.com/ob1/openbazaar).",

                "content": "OpenBazaar was released to the public on April 4th, and after two weeks of use we wanted to take a snapshot of what this emerging ecosystem of decentralized trade looks like right at the beginning. In this post we’ll walk through some stats and also talk to people who have been using the software.StatsWe’ve put out four releases of OpenBazaar over the past two weeks. Altogether, the installers for these releases have been downloaded more than 54,600 times. However, not everyone who downloads an installer ends up installing OpenBazaar and running a node on the network. Because it’s peer-to-peer it’s difficult to know exactly how many users did become a node on the network, but we can make educated guesses. BazaarBay.org is a website which runs a crawler of the OpenBazaar network in order to display content on the web. Their site collects stats as they crawl, which aren’t meant to be precise but give a rough approximation of what the network looks like. According to their stats they’ve seen ~17,800 nodes on the network in total since launch. Of those over 2,200 were vendors selling items. The total number of listings people have put up for sale is just over 6,500. At the moment there are 546 valid OpenBazaar handles that have registered a blockchain ID.StoriesStats are interesting, but we wanted to talk to some people using OpenBazaar to get a better understanding of their experience. I asked a set of questions to a few vendors on the network, as well as some developers who are building services on top of OpenBazaar.BazaarBayThis third party service was mentioned above in this post. It’s a website that acts as a way to view the OpenBazaar network via the web. The creator of BazaarBay had this to say. Why did you get involved with the project? I was looking for interesting projects to support / work on / to develop some project-related addons. OpenBazaar was just what I was looking for. It contained technologies which I’m familiar with as well as the e-commerce side + bitcoin + bit of anarchistic attitude. That’s exactly what I was looking for. Can you describe your experience with OpenBazaar over the past few weeks? Everything has been great, there has been minor technical issues. But that’s something everyone should expect from new project. Anything related to using OpenBazaar that was unexpected? I think the vendor side has been unexpectedly strong and diverse. I didn’t expect so many vendors to start selling goods &amp; services so quickly. How long have you used Bitcoin? Since launch. Anything else to mention? Because of all these positive feedback and experiences, we’re encouraged to add more resources; they will be assigned to BazaarBay development.Tyler SmithTyler is a developer building various helpful services for OpenBazaar users, such as a hosting service for OpenBazaar stores. Why did you get involved with the project? I’ve been interested in OpenBazaar since before it was forked from the DarkMarket project because I believe in free markets, decentralization, and open protocols. OpenBazaar combines the three in a way that’s extremely interesting to me by introducing a simple but powerful protocol that anybody can use to structure trade. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to get involved until mid-to-late 2015 but since then I’ve been working hard on providing tools, services, and support to the community because I think OpenBazaar can a giant success for free commerce if executed correctly. If we do things right we can enable open and unrestricted trade for all people and machines. Can you describe your experience with OpenBazaar over the past few weeks? The past couple of weeks have been extremely busy because the reception has been huge. I’ve always expected OpenBazaar to do well, but I would have never guessed at how excited, active, and helpful the community has been. I’ve gotten feedback for my services from nearly a hundred users and very quickly we’ve developed a group of enthusiastic users volunteering their time and energy to help others and report bugs. I already feel that I’ve made very good friends that I’ll keep in touch with for a long time. There were far less issues than I expected going from a pool of a dozen users to thousands in a couple of days. The issues that we did come across were quickly resolved. Working with the OpenBazaar protocol is very easy so it’s simple to adapt to rapidly incoming feedback. I look forward to helping make OpenBazaar a giant success; the ubiquitous protocol used for all commerce over networks. DutyfreeThis OpenBazaar store sells cigarettes. Store handle: @gotcigarettes Why did you start an OpenBazaar store? I’ve been waiting to open my OB store for over a year now - the promise of permissionless peer to peer trade was just too mind-blowing to ignore. The idea that for the first time in history, it will be possible for any two people on the planet to trade with one another (not even mentioning the escrow) without asking anyone’s permission, or paying intermediaries has kept me awake at night really. Having said this, I’m really proud to be sitting in the front row of the commerce revolution! Can you describe your experience with OpenBazaar over the past few weeks? Apart from a few bugs here and there (which have been patched with incredible speed), my experience has been very positive. I’ve received a dozen of orders and have two positive feedbacks already - it feels great! :) Anything related to using OpenBazaar that was unexpected? The UX and the loading speed were totally unexpected. I was definitely not expecting such a smooth first version of the OB software. How long have you used Bitcoin? I’ve been using Bitcoin for a good five years already. Anything else to mention? It’d be nice if the dev team continues to work on the privacy aspect of OB - it’s so transparent (one’s IP address is pretty much public info) that it’s a little disconcerting. Robert Valmassoi (Owner, Surf Burro)This OpenBazaar store sells Mexican blankets. Store handle: @surfburro Why did you start an OpenBazaar store? I’ve had multiple problems with dispute resolution on eBay and I have never liked their high fees, but there hasn’t been better alternatives. With what OpenBazaar provides and as a bitcoin user, it was naturally compelling. Although I plan to use it personally when I need to sell something, my company Surf Burro was a perfect first store. OpenBazaar is another outlet for us to find more customers, has no fees, and is bundled in a fairly smooth platform. Can you describe your experience with OpenBazaar over the past few weeks? Application: The program is simple and well designed. I was able to get the store setup very quickly. There has been a few bugs, but after working with the OB1 developers, they have all been resolved and the software is running smoothly now. Buying: I haven’t yet made a purchase. At the moment the catalog is lacking, but I’m sure it will increase with user growth and improved search/browsing functionality. Selling: I’m happy with the volume we’ve sold in the short amount of time. Half of our buyers chose to use a moderator, but didn’t need to start a dispute. The escrow system works great, the funds get released quickly and no chance of a chargeback to worry about. Overall I am very happy with OpenBazaar, even it its early stage. Anything related to using OpenBazaar that was unexpected? I didn’t realize how useful the chat would be. It is a much better way to communicate with customers and potential customers alike, as compared to eBay’s email-like messaging system. It has even led to a few sales. How long have you used Bitcoin? I first became interested and invested in bitcoin in 2012. Surf Burro has accepted bitcoin on our site since we started in 2014. Anything else to mention? I think OpenBazaar aligns well with bitcoin’s ideals, and is a great step towards a future of free trade. Although OpenBazaar’s youth currently shows, I can see its potential and have high hopes for its future.     Gold and Silver BazaarThis OpenBazaar store sells gold and silver coins. Store handle: @GoldandSilverBazaar I put my store up on the OpenBazaar network in the first week of your release.I was excited to see 2 sales come in within the first 48 hours. A 50 gram silver bar to a customer in France and a silver “CopBlock Quarter” to someone in the USA. I have also sold this week a “1766 Spanish Piece of Eight” Coin along with several other rare silver coins. I moved my site from my windows laptop after the first 2 days and I was unable to migrate my store to the new server. So I built a new one and my existing customers found me and were happy to report that there orders had arrived and wanted to make sure I would get the BTC before they released it. So far,  500.00 in a week! I put it up on a Digital Ocean VPS and had a difficult time keeping it up for more than 2 days at a time without it hanging and requiring me to restart the server. I have automated that process with a “cron script” for now. Recently I did an “git pull” update on both of my servers and they haven’t had issues yet.I launched a second store @thefarmersmarket  a few days ago and have had 3 sales of homemade caramels to people from around the country. I am impressed with OpenBazaar. I sell a lot on ebay and I can’t wait to spread the word for OpenBazaar Bitcoin.I am looking forward to the future of OpenBazaar.  OpenBazaar StoreWe also run a store on OpenBazaar, selling merchandise. Proceeds go to the project fund. Since launch we’ve had 221 orders placed and ran out of OpenBazaar pins the first day (more are on the way). The store now has 8,800 followers!  Growing painsWe’ve been very pleased by the community’s reception of the OpenBazaar launch, but it hasn’t gone off without a hitch. Most users could install the first release without problems, but when we released the next update (1.1.1) many Windows users couldn’t install the software, or received the message “Unable to Connect to Server.” This was a bug caused by not properly packaging OpenSSL, which was fixed in newer releases. The “Unable to Connect to Server” problem still impacts some users, and we’re working to diagnose why this is. The first three releases also had a problem with CPU usage on the server side. The server would run fine for sometime, and then spike quickly, causing it to become unresponsive for several minutes (or even crash). This issue was solved in the newest release (1.1.3). Many users have joined OpenBazaar to test out the software, but don’t keep a server running continually. For other users who later try to navigate to their page, they get a “The page you’re trying to view is currently offline” message, which is a frustrating experience. This is a current limitation of the software, and we’re working to address this issue. Vendors have reported that the shipping options are too limited, and order management is too simple. We’re aware of this (I experienced this personally when dealing with @OpenBazaar store orders) and are working to improve them.SummaryOpenBazaar had an exciting first few weeks with thousands of people using the new software. There were plenty of problems, and there’s a long way to go for decentralized trade to reach mainstream. But the developers and users building the ecosystem have finally gotten a glimpse of what permissionless trade looks like, and they’re not stopping until we can all trade free.",

You can read our user tutorial explaining how to use OpenBazaar for the first time. If you need help, join our Slack or visit our help center. If you’re not familiar with OpenBazaar, it’s a decentralized peer-to-peer network for trade that uses Bitcoin. That trade happens directly between buyers and sellers with no one in the middle - and no fees or restrictions on trade. You can read more about it at this post. Below is a press release with more details on the release.Press release“OpenBazaar Team Releases First Version of Decentralized Marketplace”Washington, DC – April 4th, 2016 - OpenBazaar - the decentralized marketplace that uses Bitcoin - is now open for business. Today, the core developers of OpenBazaar released the first version of their peer-to-peer marketplace. Project leader Brian Hoffman stated, “Trade was meant to be free. This idea inspired us to spend the last two years building OpenBazaar. Starting today, anyone in the world with access to an Internet connection can use Bitcoin and OpenBazaar to exchange goods and services freely. We can’t wait to see how people will use this tool.” Unlike the online marketplace giants Alibaba, Amazon, or eBay, this new model of online commerce isn’t controlled by any company or organization. OpenBazaar is a fully peer-to-peer marketplace where buyers and sellers engage in trade directly with each other. Because there are no middleman in the trade, users don’t pay any fees to use the network, and there are no terms and conditions to sign. OpenBazaar is permissionless trade. There are also no central authorities that act as gatekeepers and restrict trade. OpenBazaar launched a test version of their software March 1st, and saw more than 25,000 downloads from 126 countries. Users posted more than 3,000 listings to test out the software in preparation for the public release. In 2015, the OpenBazaar core-developers received funding from Union Square Ventures, Andreessen-Horowitz, and angel investor William Mougayar to form a company, enabling full-time development of the protocol and software. The company, named ‘OB1’, will continue releasing improved versions of the software over the coming months, and will begin offering services to users on the network. Users who want to join OpenBazaar can download the program for free on the OpenBazaar website. Follow OpenBazaar on Twitter, Reddit, GitHub, and on their Blog.",

            "blog-current-limitations-of-the-openbazaar-software": { 
                "title": "Current Limitations of the OpenBazaar Software", 
                "content": "Anyone with a computer and internet connection can easily install the OpenBazaar software and begin trading with anyone else in the world – for free – without permission. We firmly believe that decentralized, P2P trade is going to fundamentally change commerce for the better. However, we don’t expect this to happen overnight. Our upcoming mainnet release is only the first step in this process, and the software has some limitations. Some of these limitations are due to the nature of decentralized networks, and others are due to the limited time and resources we’ve had while building this product. We want to make sure everyone is aware of the current limitations, as well as our plan to address them if possible. OpenBazaar is an open source project and we welcome more people on board to help us tackle these challenges.Current Limitations1. Offline storesIn the current design, a user’s store must remain online for other users to see and purchase listings of goods and services. The data around listings is hosted by the store itself and not replicated elsewhere. Users who don’t want to run OpenBazaar on their own machines can choose to run their node on inexpensive dedicated hardware, such as a Raspberry Pi, or by using a VPS which will keep their store online 24/7. Addressing this limitation Because the network is entirely peer to peer, it’s a difficult problem to determine how to make storage of listings and other data accessible even when a peer goes offline. However, there are other projects working on these problems. One project is the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). Our lead back-end developer Chris Pacia has begun looking at how IPFS could be used to cache data and serve offline listings. It’s still early, but it looks promising. Our goal is to eventually transition away from the requirement of running a store continuously in order to engage in trade on the network.2. Inventory managementIn the current design, stores have only rudimentary inventory management tools. They cannot import/export listings from other platforms (e.g. TaoBao, eBay, Shopify), or specify the number of stock available for purchase. For the time being, listings need to be manually removed when they are sold out, similar to Craigslist and other classifieds. Addressing this limitation Inventory controls is a top priority feature to be added shortly after the mainnet release. Work has already begun on this issue, and the team will work closely with vendors to design and implement an inventory management system that works for them.3. SearchSearch in OpenBazaar is limited to querying the network for listings tagged with keywords that Vendors have assigned. This means that if a Vendor tags his product as ‘#tshirt’, and a buyer searches for ‘#tshirt’, they will see the Vendor’s product along with any other listing with that keyword. There are several limitations to this approach. Because the network has no central authority, there’s no way to prevent people from mislabeling the products and attaching keywords which are unrelated to their product. Also, the process of looking through the network to find related keywords is slow. There’s no room for error either; keywords must be exact matches. Addressing this limitation This limitation is characteristic of P2P networks. Fortunately, users aren’t completely reliant on the search tool in the client, and the search feature isn’t the only way to navigate the network. Bazaarbay.org is an example of a third party service which crawls the OpenBazaar network and gives users a more convenient search engine tool they’re used to. As OpenBazaar grows, similar services are expected to build their own search services. Also, users can find listings without search altogether. The Discover page shows a random sampling of other stores, and they can also put an OB link to a store or listing directly into the navigation bar.4. AnonymityOpenBazaar users don’t have their IP addresses obfuscated. This means that a malicious user may be able to tie someone’s activity on the OpenBazaar network to the location of their physical internet connection. In other areas of the design, OpenBazaar has focused on giving users more control over their own privacy. All traffic between OpenBazaar nodes is encrypted, so that others cannot see the details of transactions. This includes an end-to-end encrypted chat. Data is only seen by the parties directly involved in the trade. Addressing this limitation As OpenBazaar project lead Brian Hoffman has stated, “I think [anonymity] is, without a doubt, one of the most important, fundamental things that we need to have in OpenBazaar.” There are some ways to increase privacy now. Similar to a bittorrent node, OpenBazaar users can run their node behind a VPN now. They can also run on a VPS. We are looking at integrating other tools which enhance privacy. Tor is something we’ve thought about, but is difficult due to the fact that OpenBazaar uses UDP instead of TCP. Another tool which looks more promising is I2P, something which we’ve begun to investigate more closely. I2P already uses UDP. IPFS is working on support for IPv6, Tor, and I2P connections. If we transition to IPFS and they have completed support for these tools, then users will have more anonymity options available to them.5. ReputationThe reputation system on OpenBazaar is currently limited to buyers leaving reviews on transactions they’ve had with vendors, which are public. Reviews can only be left if a Bitcoin transaction has occurred, which prevents users from leaving reviews without actually engaging in some sort of transaction. As is true on other platforms, there’s nothing that prevents an untrustworthy vendor from pretending to be a buyer and purchasing their own product, leaving a positive review. Reviews cannot be given to buyers or moderators. It’s important that buyers and vendors trust moderators, who act as escrow agents to ensure the transaction goes through smoothly. Without a reputation system in the current version of the software, users will need to determine trustworthiness of moderators through outside channels or by moderators choosing to connect their profiles to their real life identities. Addressing this limitation Building a decentralized reputation system that can be trusted - especially when allowing for anonymous users - is an unsolved problem. Our first attempt at reputation is a simple one that requires all parties involved to be able to prove a Bitcoin transaction occurred. Future versions will allow reviews on moderators, and also will be able to use the public ratings left on vendors to do more complex analysis. Because OpenBazaar is open source, it’s also possible that third parties could do blockchain analysis to detect reputation fraud and offer their own reputation systems.Join usBuilding a peer to peer system for global trade is hard; come help us realize this vision of completely free trade.

Since our testnet release on March 1st, we’re now going to give updates on development through release notes when new versions are released. We will continue publishing weekly updates, which won’t be focused on code changes but other information around the progress of the OpenBazaar software, network, and community.Testnet ReleaseOn March 1st we released the testnet version of OpenBazaar. Over the past week we’ve been excited to see so many people download and test OpenBazaar for themselves. Since OpenBazaar is purely peer to peer, there is no central server to collect exact numbers on how many users installed OpenBazaar since testnet launch, but we can see how many users downloaded the installers from the Github repositories. Version 1.0.6 and 1.0.7 have been downloaded more than 8,000 times over the past week. The OpenBazaar testnet now has hundreds of items people are buying and selling to test out the software. http://i.imgur.com/iLyxAry.gifv In addition, we’ve seen more than 100 new issues opened on the client repository and 20 opened on the server repository. We appreciate so many people testing and reporting in order to make OpenBazaar ready for the upcoming main net release. Many testers took to Twitter to share updates and screenshots of their own OpenBazaar pages and stores. One tester made a video showing off the process of purchasing products, shown at the bottom of this post. The team is currently addressing the new open issues and responding to user feedback. Also, having so many users on the network has given us the ability to see how individual nodes respond to higher traffic. With this information we’re now focusing on optimization. We will continue to put out new releases during this testing phase until we get enough testing and feedback to feel confident switching over to the main net. There is no set deadline yet for this transition.",

                "content": "This tutorial will show users how to install OpenBazaar, navigate the network, and make purchases. If you have problems along the way, visit our help desk. If you want to chat with someone from the OpenBazaar community for help, or to give feedback on how OpenBazaar is working for you, join our Slack community.Step #1 - Download and install OpenBazaarMost users will want to download a package for their operating system, which makes installation as simple as downloading and opening a file. If you have some technical expertise and want to manually install OpenBazaar, read these instructions. The packages for release can be found on our Github releases page at this link:Download OpenBazaarWindows users use the OpenBazaar-1.X.X_Setup.exe file. After downloading and opening the file, Windows users will be guided through an installation process which should go very quickly. OS X users use the OpenBazaar-1.X.X.dmg file. Linux users use the .deb file. Download and open the file.Step #2 - Run OpenBazaar for the first timeThe first time you run OpenBazaar you will be guided through an onboarding process to personalize your experience. You will be asked a few questions such as your language, country, and preferred currency.  Each user has their own page on the OpenBazaar network. You can choose a specific theme to make your store unique.  You also have the opportunity to upload an avatar for your store. Click on “Select Avatar” to choose a file from your computer.  The last part of the onboarding process is a disclaimer about using the OpenBazaar software, which you should read before continuing. After finishing onboarding, you’ll now see your own OpenBazaar page. Here’s what an example page looks like.  Notice the long string of characters below your name, and in the navigation bar at the top of the client. This is your OpenBazaar ID, which is an address that every page on the network has. You can learn more about OpenBazaar IDs here, and how to create simpler names called “handles” here. Step #3 - View OpenBazaar listings and storesOpenBazaar is a network of users all over the world who host their own stores, and sell goods and services for Bitcoin. To view a random sampling of other stores, click on the “Discover” icon (looks like an eye) on the top right of the client. This will bring you to the main Discover page where you can view listings and stores on the OpenBazaar network.  By default you’ll see listings, but if you click on the “Pages” tab you’ll be shown a list of pages which you can connect to. This isn’t a complete list of all the pages on the network; at any one time your own computer only connects to a subset of the overall network.  Note that, by default, users will have a NSFW filter turned on that will hide listings which have been labeled NSFW by the vendor. You can turn off this filter by going into Settings &gt; General tab &gt; clicking “No” on the “Display NSFW Content?” option at the bottom &gt; Saving changes. If you see a listing which is inappropriate or offensive, you can block that user. Blocking another user means you will not see their items or store on your discover page. You can block a user by hovering over the listing and clicking “Block.” Navigation barYou can also use the navigation bar to find other stores or listings. Every listing and store has an address on the network, and putting in that address will take you there, just like a website. For example, take note of the navigation bar on this image. By default, all pages have an address like this, called the OpenBazaar ID. Putting this address into the navigation bar will take you to their page if it’s online.  Since this address isn’t memorable (similar to a Bitcoin address) there is a simpler way. OpenBazaar IDs can be tied to “Handles,” which are short names that can easily be entered into the navigation bar. For example, here’s a store with the handle @drwasho. If you want to set up your own handle, read this article.  Listings have addresses as well. The address first contains the OpenBazaar ID or Handle of the store, and then /item/ followed by the address of the specific item. For example, this listing has the following address: 8ed937277cad44f4bda553bb2bc6b47e4b4a246e/item/86fda502a9175b8173cd540a355a23eecf20ea62  Copy these addresses in client with Ctrl+C, and paste them with Ctrl+V. You can use share these addresses on the web and other OpenBazaar users can navigate directly to the addresses by pasting them in their navigation bars.Chat and followingOpenBazaar isn’t a giant ecommerce site; it’s a group of people who all want to engage in peer to peer trade. If you want to talk with those people, you can by using the built-in chat function. Chat is encrypted end-to-end for user’s privacy. On any OpenBazaar page, you can message the owner of the page by clicking the “message” button.  This opens the chat bar on the right of the client. You’ll see the user and their avatar at the top, your messages in the middle, and then a text field to type at the bottom. There’s also a dropdown on the right which allows you to view the users page and also block the user if they are harassing you.  If you want to remember a store you found, you can follow them, which will add them to your following list. On their page, click the follow button.  Then on your own page, you can click the following tab and see the stores you’ve followed. Step #4 - Buy somethingOpenBazaar is all about creating a new peer to peer network for trade, using Bitcoin. So let’s buy something! Find an item you like and click the big “BUY NOW” button. The first time you purchase something on OpenBazaar, you’re going to be asked if you have a Bitcoin wallet or not.  If you don’t, you’ll get a list of wallet providers to choose from. You’ll need Bitcoin to buy anything on OpenBazaar, so if you don’t have Bitcoin yet then you should either become a vendor on OpenBazaar and sell some items to earn some Bitcoin, or buy some elsewhere. If you have Bitcoin, then you can proceed. If the vendor has chosen moderators, you’ll be asked to select from one of two payment types: 1. Direct Payment - The buyer sends the bitcoin directly to the vendor. 2. Moderated Payment - The buyer sends the bitcoin into an escrow account and they are released when the transaction is finished. You can read more about moderators and moderated payments here. The bottom line is this: Moderated payments give the buyer some protection against the vendor taking the money and not delivering the product. But it’s important to choose a trustworthy moderator. Forums such as OpenBazaar Moderators give people a place to discuss good or bad moderators. If you choose moderated payments, then your bitcoins will be sent into an escrow account (using a unique feature of Bitcoin called multisignature addresses) that will only allow the funds to move if two out of three parties agree. Those parties are the buyer, vendor, and the moderator. This is more secure than a direct payment, in which the vendor receives payment as soon as they process the order. After you choose which payment type you want, you will be asked to enter a Bitcoin address that you control. This address is only used in case there is a refund. Once you’ve entered this refund address the first time, you will not be asked again, but you can change it in settings. If you choose to create a temporary address with RushWallet, please don’t forget to save the URL so that you don’t lose it. If you are buying a physical item, you’ll now be asked to enter a shipping address. If the vendor doesn’t ship to your country then you’ll be unable to purchase the item.  You’ll then be shown a summary screen with details of your order, and quantity, shipping information and moderator details (if it’s a moderated payment). If you are satisfied and want to place and order, click the “Pay for Order” button.  You’ll now be shown the last step in the purchasing process, the payment screen. If you’re familiar with Bitcoin then you’ve seen these QR codes many times. If you have a mobile Bitcoin wallet, simply scan the code and pay. If you have a local wallet, you can click “Open in Local Wallet” and you can finish payment there, or click “Copy to Clipboard” to get the payment address easily.  After paying you should see the payment screen change to indicate successful payment in only a few seconds.  If you don’t see anything change within a few minutes, then you can click the “Refresh Payment Status” button to manually check for payment again. You’ve bought something, what now?Step #5 - Managing ordersYou can view your purchases by clicking on the menu on the top right of the client, and then on the “Purchases” section of the dropdown menu.  This brings you to your transactions page, which shows you all of your purchases, sales (if a vendor) and cases (if a moderator). To view more details about a purchase, click on “Order Details.”  In this window you’ll see several tabs. The first is a summary tab which gives you an overview of the order. The second is a funds tab which shows the details of all the Bitcoin transactions. The third is a Discussion tab which allows you to have a conversation with the vendor, as well as open a dispute with the moderator if it was a moderated transaction.  You may also have a shipping tab if you ordered a physical item. This tab will show the shipping address you provided. This window is also where you’ll finish up your orders if you selected a moderated payment. If the vendor shipped the item or delivered the service to your satisfaction, then you should complete the order releasing the funds to the vendor. This also gives you an opportunity to leave a rating for your transaction. After the vendor confirms the order on their end, you’ll have the opportunity press the “Complete this order” on the top left of the window.  You’ll then be asked for the rating, and can scroll down to enter a text review as well. Click save and your rating will be left on the product, and funds will be released.DisputesWhat if the vendor never sends the product, or they sent something broken? If you have a problem with the vendor, the first step should be to contact them and ask for them to resolve the situation or ask for a refund. If the vendor is unresponsive or won’t cooperate, and you’ve selected a moderated transaction, you can then open a dispute and bring your case to the moderator. To do this, open the Discussion tab (we showed this above) on the order you placed. You’ll then be able to open a dispute by making your case to the moderator in the chat area, and checking a box on the bottom right labeled “Start a Dispute” then sending the message.  The moderator will then be able to see the conversation from that point out. They should work with both buyer and seller to determine who will receive the funds in the escrow. Eventually the moderator should close the transaction, which will display the message “END DISPUTE” in the chat and also give you the option to accept the payout if you were the winning party. Notice in this example the payout amounts mentioned on the top of the window. If they look right, then you can click the “Accept Dispute Payout” button.  As soon as you accept the payout the funds will be released to you. Note that the moderator will be paid a percentage of the overall transaction if they are called upon to settle a dispute.RemindersIf you want to go beyond just buying goods and services on OpenBazaar and become a vendor, you can learn more at the Vendor’s Guide. If you’re still using OpenBazaar in the test phase, you’ll need to use a testnet address and testnet coins instead of regular Bitcoin. There are more instructions in the tester’s guide.

                "content": "This article is to help OpenBazaar testers install the software, test it, and report any bugs or feedback to the development team. Thank you to all the testers out there helping us make OpenBazaar the best it can be! If you’ve already been testing and have a bug report to file or feedback to deliver, you can skip right to the reporting bugs section.OverviewTo use OpenBazaar, you will need to run the OpenBazaar server and client. If you use the pre-built packages, these will be installed together. If you build OpenBazaar manually, they will be installed separately. The server is the program doing the work of communicating with other OpenBazaar nodes and managing your Bitcoin keys. The client is the visual interface you need to interact with the rest of the network. The server and client do not need to be run on the same machine; you can set up a server on a remote machine, run your client locally, and connect them together. In the initial testing period, the OpenBazaar network will solely be running on the testnet and using testnet Bitcoins. You can receive a small amount of testnet coins from this faucet; please return them when done with testing. You can use a mobile app such as Copay or testnet3 to receive and spend the testnet coins. Listings, sales, and purchases on the testnet should be assumed to be for testing purposes only. After this period we’ll transition to testing with real Bitcoin and real listings; please read the disclaimer at the beginning of the onboarding process. There are three user roles on the OpenBazaar network. Any user can fill any role or any combination of roles.BuyerA buyer will access the network solely to purchase goods or services, check on their order status, release funds to the vendor or dispute a transaction they’re involved with, and leave reviews on vendors. Buyers don’t need to run the OpenBazaar server or client regularly. They only run them when they want to access the network.VendorA vendor will access the network in order to manage their online store. This include listing their goods or services, tracking order status, marking products as shipped, engaging in communication with buyers about open orders (or prospective clients’ questions), and managing disputes with the buyer and/or the moderator. Vendors need to run the OpenBazaar server continually in order for other users to see their listings. This can be done by running the server on local computer (anything from a typical PC to a Raspberry Pi Zero) and keeping it running 24/7, or by using a VPS such as Digital Ocean to host the server for them. Here is a guide to installing the server on a VPS. The server is not a ‘heavy-duty’ server but a lightweight program that shouldn’t interfere with the normal operation of your computer, but if users have an unstable internet connection or aren’t willing to run their computer continually, they should consider hosted solutions. A vendor can run the client locally and connect to a server running locally or running remotely. The client doesn’t need to run for other users to see their store, purchase items, or receive chat messages, but without the client running you will be unaware of these events occurring until you connect the client to server later.ModeratorsA moderator will access the network in order to offer dispute resolution services to vendors and buyers, engage in dispute resolution if it occurs, and join with the winning party to release funds from the multisignature account. OpenBazaar uses a 2-of-3 multisig escrow to prevent scams on the network. Instead of a buyer sending Bitcoin directly to a vendor (which is also an option for buyers if they want to), the default transaction in OpenBazaar is to have the vendor choose a third party called a moderator. If the buyer agrees with the vendor’s choice of moderator, then they buy the item and send the Bitcoin to a multisig address with all three parties containing one signing key. If the transaction goes smoothly and the product is delivered or service rendered, then both buyer and vendor sign to release the money to the vendor (two of three signatures). If there’s a dispute, then both buyer and vendor make their case to the moderator. The moderator makes a decision and joins with the winning party to release the funds to them, or splits funds among the parties. This means the moderator plays a vital role in preventing bad actors from scamming people, and both vendors and buyers should select them with care. Just like vendors, moderators need to have their server running in order for other users to see them. They cannot be chosen to provide dispute resolution services if their store is offline.InstallationYou can install OpenBazaar either by using a prebuilt package, or by manually installing via the command line. We want testers to use whichever they prefer, though we anticipate that most people will install OpenBazaar with a package. If you encounter an error with a package, installer, or manual installation, skip to the reporting bugs section to learn how to file a bug report.PackagesThe packages for release can be found on our Github releases page at this link:Download OpenBazaarWindows users use the OpenBazaar-1.X.X_Setup.exe file. After downloading and opening the file, Windows users will be guided through an installation process which should go very quickly. OS X users use the OpenBazaar-1.X.X.dmg file. Linux users use the .deb file. Once downloaded, open your terminal, change directory to where the .deb is located, and run “sudo dpkg -i [deb package]”. Then enter “openbazaar” in terminal and it will load.Manual installationManual installation uses the command line, and git. Users will need to use git in order to update their code; it will not update automatically. We recommend manual installation only for users who are familiar with using the command line. If you have some technical expertise and want to manually install OpenBazaar, read these instructions.TestingOnce OpenBazaar is properly installed, you can begin testing. Please ensure you are testing the latest code; if using the Windows installer or OSX package then the client should ask you to restart the client in order to use the latest code automatically. If using a manual installation on any platforms, please make sure to run ‘git pull’ on both server and client occasionally to keep updated. Feel free to play any role on the network, or all of them at once. If you are already a vendor online, consider trying to set up a store as you would if the platform were live. If you want a more methodical approach, you can use this testing script. You will first go through a brief on-boarding process where the client asks a few questions to create a better commerce experience. After that you can set up your own store and begin listing products, or start buying products from other stores (or both). Keep in mind that if you are still early in the testing phase that the network will still be using the Bitcoin testnet (using testnet coins which have no value), and all products and services should be considered only examples for testing. If a user tests off the testnet and uses real Bitcoin, they are recommended to engage in smaller trades to reduce risk of lost coins. While testing you should be keeping an eye out for two things: 1. Bugs. These are problems with the software that prevent it from acting as it is supposed to. It might be a visual bug in the client which inhibits the user experience, or it might be a bug in the back end which prevents a user from participating in the network properly. Whatever the bug is, follow the instructions below about reporting bugs. 2. Suggestions for improvement. We don’t only want to know when something goes wrong. We’re building OpenBazaar to allow anyone to engage in trade for free with anyone else in the world. That’s an ambitious goal, and we don’t expect that the first version of the software will have everything users want. We want to hear from you how we can improve the platform. This includes both small and big-picture improvements. What feature is missing? Which feature isn’t necessary? We will be releasing new versions constantly after the initial release, and we want to hear from you in order to know what is most important to work on next besides bug fixes.Reporting Bugs and Feedback BugsYou’ve found a bug and want to report it. Thanks for your help! Please follow these steps to make the process easier for you and for the developers. 1. Check to see if this bug has already been reported. You don’t want to waste your own time or the time of the developers if this bug is already a known issue. Take note of the details around the bug, and then take two steps to ensure this bug isn’t already known. First, ask users in the #testers-room channel in the OpenBazaar Slack if they’ve seen the bug. Other testers or developers will be in the room and should be able to respond if it’s a known issue. If those users are unfamiliar with the bug, or if you don’t get a response, then the next step is to check the Github issues to look for the bug. You can view issues for the Client here and issues for the Server here. Scan the titles of the last few dozen issues, and/or use the search feature to find keywords related to your issue. If you find someone has already filed your issue, you can leave a Github comment in the thread mentioning that you have encountered the same issue. Include details of your operating system and any other details which might be helpful. If you don’t find the issue, continue to step two. 2. Gather as much information as you can about the problem. Take note of what you were doing before you noticed the problem, during it, and after as well. Try to be specific. If it’s a visual bug in the client, take a screenshot or video if possible. If you are able to view the terminal readout, include any errors you can see along with ~20 lines before and after the error (errors will usually start with ‘Traceback’). If you don’t use the terminal, you can check for errors in the debug log (debug.log file in the /home/OpenBazaar/ folder). You can include the error messages in the bug report, or if it is a lot of text, you can upload the error text to Pastebin or other services and include a link to them in the report. 3. File the issue on Github. This requires you to create an account on Github if you don’t already have one. You can open new issues for the Client here and for the Server here. Bug reports should include all the information mentioned in step two, as well as information about your operating system (which type and version), how you installed OpenBazaar and what version of the code you’re currently running, and how severe you consider the bug. Attach the ‘bug’ label to the issue and then decide which other labels to apply, ranging from ‘low priority’ for minor problems to ‘showstopper’ for bugs that completely block functionality. Use your judgement as to how severe the problem is; if they developers disagree they’ll simply change the label you’ve added. If the bug is a major security flaw, please contact the developer team in Slack to ensure it is addressed properly and in a timely manner. If you’re unable to file an issue yourself for some reason, please contact a developer in the Slack and relay your information to them directly. They will file an issue.FeedbackYou have some feedback for us on how to make OpenBazaar better. Excellent; we want to hear it. Please use the following format to make it easier to review incoming feedback. New feature or change to existing feature: (Do you want new functionality completely or a change to something that already exists?) Back-end or the front-end: (Is this change in how OB works at the core, or in what the end user sees, or both?) Magnitude of change: (Trivial, Significant, or Massive. What type of effort would it take to bring about these changes?) Description of suggestion: Describe your suggestion. You have several options for delivering this feedback. 1. Github issues. You can open a new issue with your feedback. We recommend this option for users who have a specific and detailed feature request or enhancement, and one that doesn’t describe a massive magnitude of change. Please use the “enhancement” label. 2. Subreddit post. You can post to our subreddit with your feedback. We recommend this for feedback that doesn’t have a specific feature request in mind, or for changes describing a massive magnitude of change. Please begin the title of your post with the tag [Feedback]. 3. Slack. You can give feedback in our community Slack. Use the #feedback channel. We recommend using Slack if the feedback doesn’t describe a specific feature request, and is more general feedback (‘overview’ type comments). 4. Email. If for some reason you prefer for your feedback to be private instead of public, you can email the developers at project@openbazaar.org with your thoughts.ReminderPlease be patient during the testing phase; it’s possible that bugs may require you to delete your current installation entirely and reinstall. Also don’t forget that your page, store or listings will not transition from the testnet over to the live net. Thanks again for your help.",

This guide will show vendors how they can set up an OpenBazaar store, step by step. If you have problems along the way, visit our help desk. If you want to chat with someone from the OpenBazaar community for help, or to give feedback on how OpenBazaar is working for you, join our Slack community.Step #1 - Download and install OpenBazaarMost users will want to download a package for their operating system, which makes installation as simple as downloading and opening a file. If you have some technical expertise and want to manually install OpenBazaar, read these instructions. The packages for release can be found on our Github releases page at this link:Download OpenBazaarWindows users use the OpenBazaar-1.X.X_Setup.exe file. After downloading and opening the file, Windows users will be guided through an installation process which should go very quickly. OS X users use the OpenBazaar-1.X.X.dmg file. Linux users use the .deb file. Once downloaded, open your terminal, change directory to where the .deb is located, and run “sudo dpkg -i [deb package]”. Then enter “openbazaar” in terminal and it will load. Download and open the file.Step #2 - Run OpenBazaar for the first timeThe first time you run OpenBazaar you will be guided through an onboarding process to personalize your experience. You will be asked a few questions such as your language, country, and preferred currency.  Each user has their own page on the OpenBazaar network. You can choose a specific theme to make your store unique.  You also have the opportunity to upload an avatar for your store. Click on “Select Avatar” to choose a file from your computer.  The last part of the onboarding process is a disclaimer about using the OpenBazaar software, which you should read before continuing. After finishing onboarding, you’ll now see your own OpenBazaar page. Here’s what an example page looks like.  Notice the long string of characters below your name, and in the navigation bar at the top of the client. This is your OpenBazaar ID, which is an address that every page on the network has. You can learn more about OpenBazaar IDs here, and how to create simpler names called “handles” here. Step #3 - Create your storeLet’s turn your page into a store. Everyone on the network has their own page, but only people who are selling goods and services have a store. On your page, click “Become a Store.”  You will now be asked to give more information about your store. You can set a new name if you like, and add a description of your store. You can also add tags that tell buyers what your store is about. You can set your store to 18+ as well if you are selling goods or services targeted to adults.  The next step lets you select moderators. Selecting trustworthy moderators is very important. Moderators are the third party which is brought in if there is a dispute between yourself and one of your buyers. By choosing moderators, you give your buyers the option to use moderated payments instead of only direct payments, giving your buyers some confidence that you will deliver your goods or services. You can read more about how moderation works in OpenBazaar here. If you don’t choose to select any moderators, then your buyers will only be able to choose direct payments.  After selecting moderators and clicking “Finished” you’re now a store on the OpenBazaar network! You can change the color scheme, or add a new background image to your store, by clicking the “Customize” button.  Let’s get some listings published and start selling.Step #4 - Publish your first listingOn your store page, click “Create Listing.”  You’ll now see an interface to add information about your listing. After giving your listing a title, you select its type. You can either choose a physical item, a digital item, or a service. Then add the price. The price will be set in whatever currency you selected in onboarding, if you want to change it now click “Change currency.” You also select the condition of the product, and whether or not it is intended for adults (18+).  If the product has a SKU you can enter it, and then enter a description of your product. In the product description field you can edit the text to change the formatting by highlighting text with your cursor, as the picture below shows.  Scrolling down the page, you then enter information related to the processing and shipping of the listing. Processing time must be entered. You then select where your listing ships to (if it is a physical item). Buyers who listed their location in a country where you do not ship will be unable to complete an order. You have the option of choosing free shipping as well. You then add shipping prices, both domestic and international (if you ship internationally), as well as estimates on how long shipping will take.  Also in this section are your terms and conditions, and return policy. These are optional. If you want your listing to expire at a certain time, you can add an expiration date and it will automatically be removed from your store at that time. Another important piece of information to add is in the “Discover” section. The tags you add here will allow buyers to use the built in search to find your products. If you add no tags to your products buyers cannot find them via search. If you have many products, you can use the “Categorization” section to separate them into different categories. Lastly, you can add up to ten photos to your listing by slicking on the “Select photos” button. on the top right. Photos can be any size or shape, but they will display on the main Discover page, search page, and in your store as square until a buyer clicks on them. You can now scroll up and click “Save Changes” to publish your first listing.Step #5 - Manage ordersWhen you receive an order, you should hear an audio notification, and on the top right of your client you should see a new notification as well.  You can view new orders either by clicking on the item link in the notifications drop-down, or you can click on your own avatar on the top right of the page and select “Sales”. This will bring you to the Transactions page, which shows all your sales, as well as your purchases and cases (if you are a moderator).  Each sale will have an overview of the current status. Pay special attention to the “Order Status” section, which will tell you where the order currently stands. There are 6 possible statuses. 1. Purchasing (Payment pending) - This status means a buyer got to the payment page, but didn’t send payment yet (or the client has a problem seeing the payment on the blockchain). It’s recommended to ignore these orders until payment comes in. 2. Ready to process (Paid in full) - This status means the buyer paid for the order and you need to process it now. Once you’ve shipped your good or delivered your service, you then confirm. 3. Confirmed/Shipped - This status means you’ve confirmed that the product is now shipped or delivered, and you’re waiting on the buyer to release funds (if it’s a moderated payment). 4. Completed (Payment released) - This status means that the funds have been released to the vendor and the order is completed. 5. Disputed - This status means that either the buyer or vendor opened a dispute with the moderator. The funds are in the escrow and won’t move until the moderator makes a decision. 6. Dispute Closed - This status means the moderator has made a decision and the dispute is closed. The funds are still in the escrow account until the winning party agrees with the moderator’s decision and releases funds. 7. Dispute Finalized - This status means the moderator’s decision has taken affect and the funds have moved from the escrow to the winning party.Confirming ordersWhen viewing your sales, click “Order details.” This will open a window with more details. There are four tabs you can choose from: Summary, Shipping, Funds, and Discussion.  Summary gives you an overview of the information needed to process the order. Shipping gives you the address needed to ship your listing to the buyer. Funds gives you the details around the Bitcoin transactions made in the order so far. ** Discussion** gives you a place to chat with the buyer about that specific item, and also a place to handle disputes with the moderator if a dispute arises. If this order has been paid, but you haven’t confirmed yet, at the top of the window is a button to “Mark as Shipped” (for physical items) or “Confirm Order” (for digital goods or services). Once clicked, you can enter the Bitcoin address where you want to receive the funds; it’s important to enter an address which you control!  You can then add comments for the buyer. If shipping a physical item, you then enter the details around shipping: Which company is shipping the item, a tracking number, and the estimated delivery date. Then hit “Submit” and your order is now confirmed. If selling a digital good, then you’ll be asked to put in a URL and a password where the buyer can download their item. If the buyer chose a direct payment, then as soon as you confirm the order you will receive you payment at the address specified. If the buyer choose a moderated payment, the funds will arrive after the buyer receives the item and they agree to release funds, or after a dispute is opened and the moderator closes the dispute by releasing funds.RemindersOpenBazaar works differently from the common ecommerce websites. It uses two programs to function properly: the server and the client. The installer mentioned above install both automatically for you. The server needs to be running continually for other users to access your store. This means that if you shut down your computer, or loss internet access, your store isn’t visible to the rest of the network. If this is problematic, you can choose to set up the server on a virtual private server (VPS), which costs about $5 a month and will keep your store running for you. Here is a comprehensive guide for setting up the OpenBazaar server on a VPS. You can also use the Deploy service, which automatically sets up a store on a VPS for you. Also, if you are using OpenBazaar on the testnet as a tester, please remember that the store and listings you are creating now will not transfer over to the real network later. Everything made on the testnet is purely for testing only. If you encountered problems along the way, visit our help desk.

                "title": "How Moderators and Dispute Resolution Work in OpenBazaar", 
                "content": "Summary: OpenBazaar helps prevent fraud by having buyers send their bitcoins into a 2-of-3 multisignature address controlled by the buyer, seller, and a trusted third party. This third party offers dispute resolution in case something goes wrong. These third parties offer their services on an open marketplace. Because OpenBazaar is a decentralized network for trade it has a very different system for moderation and dispute resolution than existing ecommerce platforms. Traditional centralized ecommerce platforms (Amazon, eBay, Etsy, etc) have dispute resolution built into their service to reduce fraud and scams. The companies listen to disputes from a buyer or seller, make a decision to determine which party they side with, and then take action to reward the winning party or penalize the losing party. Since they control the platform directly, they have the power to issue refunds (or work with the payment processors who do), uphold negative reviews (or delete negative ones) and ban people from their platform altogether. The fees associated with using the platforms pays for this service (among other services). This type of top-down, centralized disputed resolution on the platform isn’t possible with OpenBazaar, which has no central point of control. However, a platform which had no safeguards to prevent fraud wouldn’t be very appealing to users. So OpenBazaar introduces a different model: 2-of-3 multisignature escrow along with an open marketplace for third party key holders (called moderators). If these terms don’t make sense to you, let me break it down.2-of-3 Multisignature EscrowOpenBazaar uses Bitcoin. Unlike credit cards or Paypal, Bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed after they are sent. An important part of handling fraud over existing centralized platforms is reversing charges that are fraudulent. Since Bitcoin cannot be reversed, how can it handle fraud? Fortunately Bitcoin has a unique capability called multisignature transactions (also called multisig). Instead of just having one person control the bitcoins in a certain account (called addresses), you can have multiple people control the same bitcoins. However, they can only send those coins to another address if a certain number of people controlling the bitcoins agree. For example, you can have a 2-of-2 multisig address. This means that there are two people who control the address, and both of them must agree to a transaction before the bitcoins can be sent anywhere else. A 2-of-3 address means three people control the address, and two of them must agree before the funds can be spent. OpenBazaar uses 2-of-3 multisig addresses for transactions. When a buyer wants to purchase a listing, instead of sending the funds directly to the seller, he will send the funds to the multisig account. The three people who control this account are the buyer, the seller, and a trusted third party selected beforehand. We call these trusted third parties ‘moderators’. Now there are five possible ways for the funds to be released from the multisig address:  1. The seller sends the product or delivers the service and the buyer is satisfied. The buyer and seller are the two of three parties needed for the multisig, and together they release the funds to the seller. This is what a normal transaction will look like. 2. The seller cannot deliver the listing as promised or the buyer is unhappy with the listing, and they mutually agree to refund the buyer. Again, the buyer and seller are the two of three parties needed for the multisig. This time they join together and release the funds to the buyer. 3. The buyer and seller are in a dispute and cannot agree how to release funds. The moderator comes in and decides that the seller is at fault. The moderator then joins with the buyer to release a refund to the buyer. 4. The buyer and seller are in a dispute and cannot agree how to release funds. The moderator comes in and decides that the buyer is at fault. The moderator then joins with the seller and releases the funds to the seller. 5. The buyer and seller are in a dispute and cannot agree how to release funds. The moderator comes in and decides that neither or both parties are at fault, and the moderator joins with either party to release funds in a split between buyer and seller.In this fashion fraud is prevented by only allowing funds to be sent to the seller or refunded to buyer when either 1) buyer and seller mutually agree or 2) an independent third party decides which party is at fault and joins with the winning party to release funds. In the current OpenBazaar design, moderators make money by taking a percentage of the funds they release after a dispute. This percentage is set by the moderator and publicly displayed on their profile. Future designs may allow moderators to charge for being selected for a trade, or charge based on a subscription service. Astute readers will recognize that the moderator must be trustworthy for this system to work, otherwise he/she could collude with one of the other parties to release funds to them. This is why moderator selection and reputation are important.Moderator selection and reputationIt is important that moderators are trustworthy. Competition is the best way to ensure accountability, and in OpenBazaar moderators are offered on a free market. Unlike central platforms which only offer one option for dispute resolution (themselves) on OpenBazaar these moderators are available on a marketplace within the platform itself. You can search through them and determine which one you want to use for dispute resolution, based on their own rules, or expertise, or their prices, or their real-world credentials, or based on the recommendation of other users. Over time, these moderators will develop reputations. OpenBazaar doesn’t currently have a built-in reputation system for moderators, and users will need to rely on word of mouth, real world credentials, and/or forums such as the OpenBazaar Moderators subreddit.",

                "title": "Who Controls OpenBazaar?", 
                "content": "You’re probably here because you saw or heard about something on the OpenBazaar network that was offensive, or illegal, and then someone directed you to this link to learn more. Perhaps you’re not quite familiar with what OpenBazaar is yet. There are many questions to consider: How could anyone defend this? How come it’s not shut down? Who controls OpenBazaar? This post is meant to answer these questions. First of all, you’ll need to take a moment to understand what OpenBazaar is. Or more importantly, what it isn’t.OpenBazaar is not a website, a company, or an organizationMost people are familiar with the standard ecommerce model. A company – such as eBay, Amazon, or Etsy – has a popular website where people buy and sell stuff. The company directly controls the trade on their own website. You don’t hear about illegal or immoral goods sold on these websites because the companies won’t allow it. They remove any such listings. This model is a centralized model, because there is one central authority that can make decisions and control what happens. This image shows a centralized model. The central hub is the website, which all the nodes (users) connect directly to. Everything happens in the central hub; users don’t interact with each other directly. If the hub (website) goes down, no one can do anything at all. [caption id=”attachment_766” align=”aligncenter” width=”413”] Centralized network[/caption] This is not how OpenBazaar works.OpenBazaar is decentralized, peer to peer, and has no central authorityOpenBazaar is not a website. It is a peer to peer network of people around the world running software on their own computers. This is a decentralized model; there is no central authority that can make decisions and control what happens. If some people on the network have trouble with their computers or internet connection, other users are unaffected. They will still connect directly to each other. This image shows a decentralized model. Unlike the centralized network pictured above, it has no central hub. All the nodes (users) are connecting directly to one another. [caption id=”attachment_771” align=”aligncenter” width=”365”] Decentralized network[/caption] This is how OpenBazaar works. Users download the software onto their computers, and they buy and sell goods and services directly with each other. A seller lists items on their own store, which is hosted on their own computer. The only way for that store or that listing to be taken off the network is for the user to take it down themselves, or for someone to physically visit their home or business and shut down their computer.Removing offensive listings or storesWith this decentralized model there is no central authority on the network which can take down their store or listings, even if they are offensive. The developers of OpenBazaar - in fact, no one at all - have any control over the activity on the network. We don’t give permission to users to join the network; anyone can join by running the software on their computer. We aren’t making money from selling the software; it’s open source which means the code is open for all to see and use without any cost. There is one method to remove offensive listings or stores. A store which is breaking the law can be reported to law enforcement. They can then attempt to track down the store, find the computer hosting it, and take it off the network.Why decentralized?You might be wondering why we would build a marketplace which could be used for offensive or illegal goods and services. First, it’s important to understand all the benefits that the decentralized model of online trade offers over the traditional, centralized model.  Cheaper trade.A vendor on eBay is usually charged 10% of each sale. It’s 15% on Amazon. These fees are an enormous cost of doing business on centralized platforms. OpenBazaar has no middleman taking a cut, so the vendor is charged 0% for each sale. Vendors can pass on some of the savings to their customers resulting in less expensive goods and services.  Borderless trade.Many popular online marketplaces aren’t available in every country. The popular payment methods available online such as credit cards or PayPal aren’t available in many countries. Engaging in international trade for people in these countries can be nearly impossible. OpenBazaar has no geographical restrictions, and it uses Bitcoin, which also is global. Anyone in the world with a computer and an internet connection can use OpenBazaar.  Trade with cheaper and better escrow.Centralized marketplaces have a monopoly on trust, safety, and payments via escrow. It’s the reason why they can get away with charging high fees – users only have one choice. They also have complete control over funds, so users are forced to trust them completely. OpenBazaar does not have a monopoly on escrow. Instead there is an open market of third-party escrow services (called “Moderators”) which buyer and seller can mutually select. Having an open, competitive market for escrow services means fees will almost always be lower than monopolized platforms. Escrow on OpenBazaar uses a feature of Bitcoin called Multisignature transactions which means the escrow agent doesn’t control the funds directly, but controls them jointly with the buyer and the seller. Two out of three of them need to agree before funds are released. This leads to more secure escrow. Using an escrow service is optional. If buyer and seller trust each other, they can transact directly without involving a third party.  Secure trade.In order to use the centralized platforms, you need to give them your personal data, or use a payment method which is tied to your identity (usually credit cards). Unfortunately, this information is a prime target for hackers to steal and use your personal or financial information for their personal gain. OpenBazaar has no account to sign up for, and you only share as much information about yourself with other users as you choose. It also uses Bitcoin, which means there are no credit cards numbers in a big database for hackers to steal.  No restrictions.Centralized markets force their users to agree to their own “terms and conditions.” While some of these rules make sense to most vendors (preventing the offensive goods from being posted), other don’t. For example, Amazon recently banned the sale of some of their competitors products, for their own benefit. Etsy bans spells and other non-physical items, as well as banning the sale of merchandise from the Washington Redskins. None of these restrictions exist on OpenBazaar.We built a tool which allows anyone with a computer and an internet connection to trade directly with anyone else in the world – for free – and we’re proud of that. The offensive listings must be viewing in context of the overall activity on the network, of which the vast majority is legitimate trade that makes everyone better off. We hate it when people abuse our technology, but the fact is that they alone are responsible for their own actions. The internet itself is a decentralized system. Many people abuse this to do illegal or immoral things. However, we’ve collectively decided that the incredible benefits the internet has brought far outweigh the bad, and we do our best to reward the good while punishing the bad. The same should be true of OpenBazaar.",

                "content": "OpenBazaar is, among other things, a contracting platform that enables two or more parties to trade any thing. But if there is a common theme to the last few articles we have published, it is that the applications don’t stop at traditional e-commerce.One application of particular interest is the formation of speculative contracts that depend on the unknown future state of an object or event.Speculative contracts are a fundamental component of the market economy. They form the basis of insurance policies, loans, and futures markets just to name a few.Typically, enforcement of speculative contracts are handled through the courts or trusted third parties that have exclusive control of funds. With Bitcoin and Ricardian contracts, speculative contracts can be resolved directly between two parties, or in cooperation with a mutually selected third party in the event of a dispute.To achieve this in OpenBazaar, we need to define a new user role on the network, an Oracle, who will report on the state of an object or event in the future. Secondly, we will need a Ricardian contract schema for various types of speculative contracts, which we will refer to as risk contracts.This article will review the role of Oracles in OpenBazaar and how risk contracts will be settled on the platform.OraclesOracles are nodes on the OpenBazaar network that report on the state of any object or event in the future. Based on the Oracle’s report, a risk contract is settled in favor of the user who correctly predicted the future state.In OpenBazaar, the responsibilities of an Oracle will depend on the individual user. In short, they can either serve as a:  Reporter  Escrow agent (i.e. Moderator)As a reporter, the Oracle can publicly report on the state of an object or event over time, which will serve as a data input for risk contracts between other users. These users may have little or no interaction with the Oracle directly, who can serve state reports in plain-text publicly or via OpenBazaar’s instant messaging service. Oracles may even report the state of an object or event using their own sophisticated APIs similar to Reality Keys. Critically, reporterOracles do not handle any user funds and are not Moderators.Oracles can also serve as the escrow agent or Moderators, where the future_state_ of the object or event, which they report on, is the basis of releasing funds from multisignature escrow to the appropriate party. Releasing funds would be done in cooperation with the winning party. This service may only be necessary if the losing party is a sore loser, refusing to release funds for immature reasons. Ideally, Oracles would only be required to release funds in the event of a dispute.Just as with Moderators, an open market for Oracles introduces competitive forces and diversity to improve the quality and range of data sources. Oracles_can advertise what categories of objects or events they will report on, and why they are uniquely qualified over their peers. The _Oracle’s reputation system will reflect how accurately they report state and citing reputable sources.Any user can become an Oracle.Risk ContractsRisk contracts are a class of Ricardian contract that settle the transfer of funds to a party based on the future state of an object or event. There are four types of risk contracts that OpenBazaar will support:  Lending and Bonds (peer-to-peer loans, debt securities)  Insurance (dispute insurance, traditional consumer/business insurance)  Forward and Futures (asset price speculation)  Prediction/Information (object or event state speculation)For nearly all of these classes of risk contracts, an Oracle is required to validate the state of an object or event. In some contracts, the Moderator will act as the Oracle.The risk contract schema is comparable to that of typical e-commerce Ricardian contracts in OpenBazaar. As a quick refresher, every _listing contract_has the following objects that are filled with data:  Metadata object — related to the type of contract and version of the contract  ID of the Vendor object — e.g. GUID, blockchain ID (if stated), public keys  Market object — semantic properties of the thing being sold  Policy object— Terms and conditions, returns (if relevant)  Moderator object— ID and public keys of the ModeratorAll of the above objects are signed with the Vendor’s GUID to complete the listing contract that is published to the network.In e-commerce contracts, the market object describes the physical/digital good or the type of service the user will perform. For example, this is the market object for a physical item:“item” : {    “title” : “”,    “description” : “”,    “condition” : “”,    “price_per_unit” : {       “bitcoin” : “”,       “fiat” : {          “price” : “”,          “currency_code” : “”       }    },    “item_properties” : “”,    “quantity” : “”,    “category” : [ “” ],    “image_hashes” : [ “” ],    “keywords” : [ “” ],    “process_time” : “”,    “sku” : “”}The market object will list specific contract details depending on the type of risk contract it is (e.g. loans: principal, interest, term; insurance: policy T&amp;Cs, premiums, excess etc). The reference market object, which captures the details for all types of risk contracts, is:“risk” : {   “type” : “”,                // Risk contract type   “description” : “”,         // Description of loan, policy, etc   “loan” : {                  // Denominated in bitcoin or fiat      “bitcoin” : “”,      “fiat” : {         “price” : “”,         “currency_code” : “”      }   },   “loan_repayments” : {      “interest_rate_pa”: 0,   // % per annum      “interest_calc”: “”,     // Daily, monthly, year      “repayments_sched”: “”,  // Repayment schedule      “bitcoin” : “”,          // Denominated in bitcoin or fiat      “fiat” : {         “price” : “”,         “currency_code” : “”      }   },   “loan_collateral” : {       // Denominated in bitcoin or fiat      “bitcoin” : “”,      “fiat” : {         “price” : “”,         “currency_code” : “”      }   },   “insurance_type” : “”,      // Full, partial, zero-limit   “policy_limit” : {          // Denominated in bitcoin or fiat      “bitcoin” : “”,      “fiat” : {         “price” : “”,         “currency_code” : “”      }   },   “insurance_reserve” : 0,    // % collateral to be kept in escrow   “insurance_coverage” : “”,  // What the policy covers   “insurance_premium” : {         “type” : “”,             // One-off or regular      “schedule” : “”,         // Payment frequency      “bitcoin” : “”,          // Denominated in bitcoin or fiat      “fiat” : {         “price” : “”,         “currency_code” : “”      }   },   “insurance_excess” : {      // Denominated in bitcoin or fiat      “bitcoin” : “”,      “fiat” : {         “price” : “”,         “currency_code” : “”      }   },   “futures_asset” : “”,       // Name of the asset   “limit_per_unit”: {         // Max up/down exposure      “bitcoin” : “”,      “fiat” : {         “price” : “”,         “currency_code” : “”      }   },   “prediction_state” : “”,    // Future state of object/event   “units” : “”,               // Quantity of asset/shares purchased   “price_per_unit” : {        // Future price; bitcoin or fiat      “bitcoin” : “”,      “fiat” : {         “price” : “”,         “currency_code” : “”      }   },   “position” : “”,            // Short, long   “term_days”: “”,            // Term of the contract   “oracle_source” : “”,       // Oracle user ID + sources   “keywords”: []              // Enhanced search}For each type of risk contract discussed below, we will examine the schema of the market object and briefly touch on the mechanics of the trade flow.Lending and BondsPeer-to-peer loans and bonds can be offered in OpenBazaar using the following market object:“risk” : {   “type” : “loan”,   “description” : “”,         // Description of the loan   “loan_repayments” : {      “interest_rate_pa”: 0,   // % per annum      “interest_calc”: “”,     // Daily, monthly, year      “repayments_sched”: “”,  // Repayment schedule      “bitcoin” : “”,          // Denominated in bitcoin or fiat      “fiat” : {         “price” : “”,         “currency_code” : “”      }   },   “term”: “”,                 // Term of the loan   “loan_collateral” : {       // Denominated in bitcoin or fiat      “bitcoin” : “”,      “fiat” : {         “price” : “”,         “currency_code” : “”      }   },   “keywords”: []}For this type of contract, the Moderator acts as the Oracle, as the repayments are made to the Lender from the Buyer in bitcoin. The role of the Oracle in this scenario is to regulate the release of collateral (i.e. a reserve requirement) from the multisignature escrow address once the loan is repaid or the borrower has defaulted.In terms of discovery, the borrower may place an invitation to tender for a loan, where the above listing contract is a tender proposal. Creditors can submit their loan offers to the borrower, who sorts through the competing offers to select one with the best terms.This approach would give creditors a great deal of flexibility to tailor and compete on parameters such as the interest rate, reserve requirement, term, and repayment schedule based on the reputation of the borrower. Indeed, the creditor may require higher interest rates and collateral for pseudonymous users with a limited or poor reputation, relative to pseudonymous users with a high reputation or users with several public endpoints connected to their Blockchain ID.An alternate approach is for the creditor to offer standardized loans (i.e. bonds) on the network. Other users can purchase these bonds from the creditor, receiving interest repayments as per a normal bond. As this market matures, users will buy and sell bonds as a typical financial asset on the OpenBazaar network.Unlike physical or digital goods, or services, the trade flow is more straightforward after the loan is approved/bond purchased. Bitcoin repayments on principal and interest payments are made to addresses specified in the contract (stage 3 of the trade flow).The OpenBazaar application will keep track of repayments and manage dispute resolution through the Moderator as per normal.InsuranceInsurance contracts in OpenBazaar can be offered in one of three forms:  Fully collateralized  Partially collateralized  No limitA fully collateralized insurance contract would lock the entire value of the policy (i.e. the maximum coverage limit) in multisignature escrow, while the policyholder pays regular premiums to the insurer.Theoretically, the accrued premiums plus collateral would be equal to the policy limit, but this may place the insurer at a financial disadvantage given that the policy funds are locked and are not yielding any interest.However, if there is no claim on the policy, the insurer will collect premiums that can be loosely considered a financial coupon that yields the insurer a reward for risking funds up-front for the policyholder. The pseudo coupon rate may be higher than low-yield government bonds, but significantly more risky. This may also turn insurance policies in OpenBazaar into tradeable financial instruments.Premiums for this type of insurance contract may be higher than standard policies, and may even exceed the policy limit. However, in exchange for the higher premiums, the policyholder is secure in the knowledge that if the policy is triggered, all of the funds are accessible.Unlike partially collateralized insurance contracts, there is zero chance of the insurer defaulting due to an inability to pay the policy limit, at the cost of the policyholder. This represents a significant technological advance in the insurance industry.A partially collateralized insurance contract only locks a percentage of the policy’s value in multisignature escrow throughout the life of the policy.As the full limit of the insurance policy is no longer locked in a multisignature escrow, the policyholder is now trusting the insurer to transfer the necessary amount of funds in the event of a claim. There is a risk of the insurer defaulting, which may be caused by financial mismanagement, higher than expected frequency/severity of claims, or simply fraud. A combination of regulation, reinsurance contracts, and transparent proof of reserves could potentially be used to mitigate the risk of the insurer defaulting.Partially collateralized insurance contracts characterizes the modern regulated insurance industry. This is only possible for traditional insurance companies because of the pooling of contracts, regulation, and access to reinsurance.A no limit insurance contracts technically fall under the ‘partially collateralized’ category. This contract doesn’t set a maximum coverage (i.e. the insurer is fully exposed to the total value of the item insured). Any amount of funds may be locked in multisignature escrow as collateral.The market object for all insurance contracts:“risk” : {   “type” : “insurance”,   “description” : “”,         // Description of policy   “insurance_type” : “”,      // Full, partial, zero-limit   “policy_limit” : {          // Denominated in bitcoin or fiat      “bitcoin” : “”,      “fiat” : {         “price” : “”,         “currency_code” : “”      }   },   “insurance_reserve” : 0,    // % collateral to be kept in escrow   “insurance_coverage” : “”,  // What the policy covers   “insurance_premium” : {         “type” : “”,             // One-off or regular      “schedule” : “”,         // Payment frequency      “bitcoin” : “”,          // Denominated in bitcoin or fiat      “fiat” : {         “price” : “”,         “currency_code” : “”      }   },   “insurance_excess” : {      // Denominated in bitcoin or fiat      “bitcoin” : “”,      “fiat” : {         “price” : “”,         “currency_code” : “”      }   },   “term_days”: “”,            // Term of the contract   “keywords”: []              // Enhanced search}If a claim is triggered, it may require the existing insurance contract to be replaced with a new insurance contract.Insurance contracts could be created for several applications such as:  Dispute resolution insurance — in the event that a Vendor loses a disputed transaction in OpenBazaar  Traditional consumer/commercial insurance — e.g. car insurance, house insurance, health insurance  Credit default swaps — an insurance risk contract can be taken out to hedge against the risk of a loan/bond defaulting.Some of these contracts may require interaction with legacy stakeholders (i.e. the government), which will be the subject of a future article.Forward and FuturesForward and futures contracts allow two parties to speculate or hedge against the price of any asset.For example, a wheat farmer may take out a forward contract locking a sell order at a price of $100/bushel a year from now. This price would presumably guarantee the farmer to profit by an acceptable margin (provided at least X bushels are sold at that time), irrespective of whatever the actual market price is at the time.With the forward contract, the farmer sacrifices any profit that he might have gained had he risked selling at the market price a year later, if the market price had risen (e.g. $150/bush). Simultaneously, the forward contract_protects_ the farmer from potential losses if the market price decreases a year from now (e.g. $50/bushel).Typically, neither party intend to physically purchase/sell the underlying asset. Rather, they novate to settle the contract. Pure price speculation/hedging is the common purpose of forward/futures contracts.The unique design of forward/futures contracts in OpenBazaar is described in some detail here. The updated market object schema for forward/futures contracts:“risk” : {   “type” : “forward/futures”,    “description” : “”,         // Description of forward/future   “futures_asset” : “”,       // Name of the asset   “price_per_unit” : {        // Future price; bitcoin or fiat      “bitcoin” : “”,      “fiat” : {         “price” : “”,         “currency_code” : “”      }   },    “limit_per_unit”: {         // Max up/down exposure      “bitcoin” : “”,      “fiat” : {         “price” : “”,         “currency_code” : “”      }   },   “units” : “”,               // Quantity of asset purchased   “position” : “”,            // Short, long, moderator   “term_days”: “”,            // Term of the contract   “oracle_source” : “”,       // Oracle user ID + sources   “keywords”: []              // Enhanced search}Under the ‘spot_price_source’ object, either an API source or an Oracle ID can be added to establish consensus on the tie-breaking rules governing the settlement of the contract.Prediction/InformationWhile forward and futures contract speculate and hedge against the price of an asset, prediction markets speculate and hedge against the future state any object or event.For example, a prediction contract can be established between Alice and Bob based on whether it will rain the next day in Brisbane, Australia. Alice and Bob deposit 0.5 bitcoin into 2-of-3 multisignature escrow (Moderator as backup); the total value in escrow is 1 bitcoin. Alice goes long (i.e. predicts rain) while Bob goes short on rain tomorrow. The next day comes and it rains; 1 bitcoin is paid out to Alice from escrow. If Bob doesn’t live in Brisbane, he may check with the Oracle (or the Weather Channel) to confirm that it did indeed rain before releasing the funds.In this example, the chance of rain was 50%. But imagine that Alice and Bob both know that the chances of rain the next day, according to the Weather Channel, is 90%. Alice, predicting rain, deposits 0.9 bitcoin into multisignature escrow, while Bob deposits 0.1 bitcoin. As before, the winner is paid out 1 bitcoin from escrow. While ostensibly it seems that Alice is risking more than Bob, in reality her risk is lower than Bob based on the knowledge provided by the Weather Channel. In other words, the odds are overwhelmingly in Alice’s favor to collect Bob’s 0.1 bitcoin. Another way to see it is that Alice is paying a premium, in terms of risk, to entice Bob to risk his bitcoin on the outcome of an event that is unlikely to go in his favor.There are a few key components to prediction markets:  Selecting an appropriate Oracle  Listing and/or discovering available prediction contractsSelecting an OracleThe OpenBazaar application will allow users to query the network for nodes that have identified themselves as Oracles, much in the same way that Moderators will be selected.Users will be able to sort through Oracles based on reputation, category (e.g. Oracles dedicated to reporting sports games, weather, news etc), or fees. Oracles can also describe on their store-front in detail what type of reporting they perform and the sources they rely on.As stated earlier, an Oracle may act as either a reporting source or Moderator in a prediction contract.Discovering Prediction ContractsDiscovery of prediction contracts is a key challenge to form an efficient prediction market.Prediction contracts can be formed between two users on an ad hoc basis, with the details negotiated directly between them. In this case, either party can create the listing contract.Alternatively, prediction contracts could be created by Oracles who commit to: 1) reporting on the state of a future event, and 2) acting as a Moderator for any prediction contracts that arise from that report. Oracles would create the contract as a Moderator, leaving open slots for a long and short position on the event. The price per share of each contract, which reflects the likelihood of the event occurring, can be dynamically updated by the Oracle in real time based on their ability to match users going long or short.OpenBazaar has a ‘follow’ feature to enable notifications, which means that a user can be notified from the Oracle when new events will be reported on or new prediction contracts become available.To minimize trust, prediction contracts can be coordinated by neutral Moderators who are not Oracles, who rather cite a user(s) or source as the_Oracle._The market object for prediction contracts:“risk” : {   “type” : “prediction”,   “description” : “”,         // Description of prediction   “prediction_state” : “”,    // Future state of object/event   “units” : “”,               // Quantity of shares purchased   “price_per_unit” : {        // Future price; bitcoin or fiat      “bitcoin” : “”,      “fiat” : {         “price” : “”,         “currency_code” : “”      }   },   “position” : “”,            // Short, long   “term_days”: “”,            // Term of the contract   “oracle_source” : “”,       // Oracle user ID + sources   “keywords”: []              // Enhanced search}There are several projects attempting to create decentralized prediction markets, such as Augur and Truthcoin. Undoubtedly there are potential collaborative opportunities, particularly when it comes to resolving state in a decentralized manner.What is the key difference between what we hope to implement in OpenBazaar versus say Augur? The core difference is mostly philosophical: we believe that low friction markets for third party Oracles can create a supply of highly reputable state reporting, at near marginal cost and at scale, over time.While Augur is attempting to create the purest form of near-trustless state reporting (kudos to them!), we believe that markets for third party _Oracles_can solve most of the challenges associated with creating a decentralized prediction market at a fraction of the technical difficulty. High value prediction contracts may benefit from the more sophisticated and lower trust-dependent approach taken by Augur.DeploymentImplementation of risk contracts by OB1 developers is not expected until sometime next year. However, deployment may occur sooner with the help of volunteer and/or commercial contributors or partners.That said, the existing contract schema can be tailored to include the semantic data required for most risk contracts described in this article. Moderators can also include Oracle-based services in their store description. As a result, we may see some early experiments in risk contracts in lieu of an official implementation.TL;DR  OpenBazaar will enable a new user role: Oracles  Anyone can be an Oracle  Oracles can choose the level of involvement in individual transactions, from reporting to Moderating transactions  Risk contracts to be supported by OpenBazaar that will enable lending, insurance, forward/futures, and prediction marketsAcknowledgements  Austin Williams  Michael Folkson  Dr Joseph Clark  Dr David Strayhorn  Sam Patterson  Ian Grigg",

                "title": "Decentralized Reputation - Part 2", 
                "content": "In part 1, we introduced the reputation system for OpenBazaar.We learned that Vendor or Moderator reputation is composed of individual transaction ratings. Transaction ratings feed into a reputation score, with granular detail related to their activity as either a Vendor or Moderator. Transaction ratings are tied to a bitcoin transaction and recorded as a JSON-formatted transaction summary of the trade.Transaction summaries contain the minimum amount of metadata required to provably link a Vendor to a bitcoin transaction and listing contract, while maintaining the privacy of the Buyer by default.Users that desire to know the reputation of a Vendor can download the full history of transaction summaries directly from the Vendor or a third party (e.g. Moderator).Towards the end of the article, I hinted that third parties could take the transaction summaries as ‘units of reputation data’ to calculate their own version of a reputation score, which would be different from OpenBazaar’s native algorithm.In this article we will explore these concepts in greater detail, and unpack how transaction summaries can be processed to add value to reputation score in OpenBazaar.Cost of IdentityA frequent obstacle in any system where reputation is involved is the threat of Sybil attacks.  In a Sybil attack the attacker subverts the reputation system of a peer-to-peer network by creating a large number of pseudonymous identities, using them to gain a disproportionately large influence. A reputation system’s vulnerability to a Sybil attack depends on how cheaply identities can be generated, the degree to which the reputation system accepts inputs from entities that do not have a chain of trust linking them to a trusted entity, and whether the reputation system treats all entities identically. (Source)Previously we described the first-line of defense against Sybil attack in OpenBazaar, which was the proof-of-work required to generate a global unique identifier (GUID) for the network. Using non-specialized hardware, generating a GUID will take approximately 30 seconds. However, given the prevalence of a specialized hardware related to various proof-of-work systems, we cannot exclusively depend on this approach to impose a cost per identity.A financial cost can be associated with an OpenBazaar GUID to help combat Sybil attacks and enhance the value of a reputation score (when the GUID of the Buyer is disclosed in the transaction summary).Like a proof of work, a financial cost for a GUID means that contributing data to the network, in the form of ratings and reviews, is not free. This cost or reputation pledge, at some point, makes it economically irrational to create fake identities and thus fake ratings.There are a variety of ways to make a reputation pledge:  Proof of burn  CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY  Security depositWe will briefly touch on each approach below with an example of a market price of $5 (~0.02 BTC at the time of writing) for a reputation pledge.Proof of BurnProof of burn involves sending bitcoin to an address where the private key will be virtually impossible to calculate. The funds sent to this address are permanently unspendable and represent the purest form of commitment. Nevertheless, for many (including the author) there is an unsettling emotional cost, despite the net economic benefit it gives to all users.For example, an attacking Vendor would need to burn $100 (0.4 BTC) to create 20 reputation pledges for each fake identity making a positive rating. However, the $100 burn only represents the present cost to creating these identities. There is a future cost, in terms of deflationary value, in losing 0.4 BTC that may be worth significantly more than $100 months or years from now.In terms of implementation, OpenBazaar may support this feature, but would be unsurprised if few use it in favor over other alternatives.CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFYCHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY would have a user send bitcoin to themselves (i.e. another address that the user controls) in such a way that these funds would be ‘unspendable’ until a future date. The funds in this type of transaction will not be accepted into a block until a specific Unix time or block height.Unlike proof of burn, the $100 reputation pledge would not be permanently lost but temporarily inaccessible to a Vendor. The time period may be anywhere from weeks, months, or even years.This approach isn’t particularly effective against attackers with a long time preference, but should be sufficient for most users when the value of items being traded are less than the locked funds.Security DepositA third party, or federation of third parties, hold a sum of funds from a user in multisignature escrow for a period of time as a security deposit. In the event of poor behavior by the user in a transaction or interaction, damages can be deducted from the security deposit to: 1) compensate the offended party, or 2) impose a punitive action.The weakness of this approach is that the user must trust the third party, and the rest of the network must value the integrity of the third party. While certainly not ideal from a pure decentralist, zero-trust point of view, this service may emerge as a popular choice if reputable players enter this market.Counting the CostIrrespective of the approach used to make a reputation pledge, we can arrive at an estimate of the total cost of a Sybil attack for the overall reputation score of a Vendor or Moderator. This is calculated by:  Assuming all users that contributed to the reputation score are sockpuppets  Summing the reputation pledges of each identity.[caption id=”attachment_633” align=”aligncenter” width=”678”] Assuming each identity is secretly created by Alice, it would have cost her $100 in reputation pledges.[/caption]The Sybil cost represents the maximum amount Alice would have paid to create a 100% fake reputation score; the actual cost may be lower if other users have legitimately rated her positively. Ancillary costs involved in a Sybil attack are not included in this estimate, only the reputation pledge values for each identity.Users can have some assurance when dealing with a counterparty that has a Sybil cost larger than the value to be traded. For example, if Fred wanted to sell a music track to Alice for $3, it is economically irrational for Alice to spend $100 to defraud Bob out of a $3 item. If the value of the item was $1000, then Bob would need to carefully consider his counterparty risk if Alice’s _Sybil cost _is only $100.While seemingly complex, this economic reputation calculation exists in TaoBao, where Vendors put up security deposits in exchange for a badge to solicit trust from potential Buyers. The larger the security deposit, the more likely Buyers will feel safer transacting with the Vendor.Transaction SummariesThe aggregate history of transaction summaries of a user is the data-set to calculate the reputation score. However, transaction summaries can be excluded from the calculation based on certain criteria. The purpose of this is to enhance the value of a reputation score to more accurately predict the integrity of a user in future trades.The 3 SeashellsOne approach is to break up the reputation score, of the Vendor or Moderator, into 3 classes or the ‘3 seashells’.[caption id=”attachment_634” align=”aligncenter” width=”648”] The 3 Seashells… yes I’m a fan of Demolition Man[/caption]Seashell 1: All (red; low reliability)The reputation score is calculated from all transaction summaries that can be found on the network for a Vendor or Moderator. The GUID of the Buyer does not need to be disclosed. Equal weight is assigned to all transaction summaries on the assumption they are all from authentic trades_._[caption id=”attachment_635” align=”aligncenter” width=”648”] All transaction summaries are counted, even if the Buyer’s GUID isn’t not disclosed.[/caption]If Buyer’s GUID is undisclosed, they are represented by the Bitcoin address (and signature) from the payout transaction from multisignature escrow address or input address in a direct transaction.Seashell 2: Public (yellow: some reliability)The reputation score is calculated from transaction summaries where the GUID of the Buyer is disclosed. Any transaction summaries where the Buyer is only represented by a Bitcoin address (i.e. an anonymous transaction) are discarded.[caption id=”attachment_636” align=”aligncenter” width=”648”] Transaction summaries without the Buyer GUID disclosed are discarded.[/caption]The assumption here is that the requirement of the Buyer’s GUID subjects the rating to:  A minimum proof-of-work to create an OpenBazaar identity  Transparency on the network  An association of a GUID with a bitcoin transaction; coin analysis can be performedSeashell 3: Web-of-Trust (green: excellent reliability)The reputation score is calculated from transaction summaries where theBuyer’s GUID is within the user’s web-of-trust graph (WoT).[caption id=”attachment_637” align=”aligncenter” width=”648”] If Alice is the target and Ed is the observer, only the transaction summaries in Ed’s web-of-trust are accepted when calculating Alice’s reputation score.[/caption]The assumption here is that you are more likely to believe ratings made by people you trust compared to pseudonymous or random identities on the network.Web-of-TrustThere are several WoT architectures to choose from. In OpenBazaar, the WoT can be as simple as a graph of nodes that the user follows. Alternatively, there are more complex proposals that we will briefly touch on below.Web-of-trust #1: Zindros[caption id=”attachment_638” align=”aligncenter” width=”648”] Zindros web-of-trust[/caption]This approach was named after OpenBazaar core contributor Dionysis Zindros, who wrote up a comprehensive specification outlined here.The Zindros WoT uses proof-of-burn to introduce a cost to create an identity. Only partial knowledge of the whole web-of-trust graph is known by any one user.To calculate the reputation score of a target node Bob (in context of transaction summaries used in OpenBazaar), Alice queries her friends (i.e. nodes within her WoT) to return:  Transaction summaries of Bob  Transaction summaries of Bob that their friends and friends-of-friends (up to n degrees of freedom) may haveThe overall reputation score would be calculated based transaction ratings weighted based on the proximity of the target (Bob) to Alice’s friends in her WoT.Web-of-trust #2: Line of CreditThis designs differs from traditional web-of-trust designs in that is uses a Bitcoin line of credit as the trust edges (i.e. the connections between nodes) rather than esoteric ratings, vouches, or points. If a user on the network has large and multiple lines of credit from other nodes, then this would be a quantifiable financial indicator of trust.The line-of-credit (LoC) may either be a 1-of-2 (high liquidity, high trust) or 2-of-2 (low liquidity, low trust) escrow address where funds are deposited between two nodes. If Alice is added to Bob’s WoT, Bob would deposit bitcoin in a 1-of-2 escrow address that Alice can draw from at any time for any purpose.[caption id=”attachment_639” align=”aligncenter” width=”777”] Trust is measured by the total amount of credit a user can draw from other users on the network.[/caption]The OpenBazaar application would keep track of funds borrowed, interest levels, repayment schedules etc, which would contribute to more public metadata to assess the trustworthiness of a user_._ Users are incentivized to open a line of credit to a reputable Vendor, who is likely to earn them interest.One advantage of this approach is that it simultaneously requires a cost for each identity to establish trust, creating a financial disincentive for _Sybil _attacks.Some variations of this idea may be extended to bi-directional micropayment channels to be used in the lightning network.FiltersIn addition to the three major classes above, transaction summaries can be filtered according various parameters to calculate the reputation score.Blockchain IDOnly transaction summaries with a disclosed GUID and a Blockchain ID are included in the reputation score calculation. Furthermore, transaction ratings may be weighted based on the number of external verified accounts associated with a Blockchain ID (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, PGP etc). This approach would attempt to favor transaction ratings from verifiable real world identities rather than anonymous or purely pseudonymous users.Coin AnalysisEach transaction summary is tied to bitcoin transaction where funds are released to the Vendor as a result of a successful OpenBazaar trade. This transaction can be analysed in conjunction with other transactions associated with the user to assess the likelihood the same coins were used for both transactions.If the same coins were used, then there is a high chance that the user is attempting to fake a rating, and the associated transaction summary with the rating data can be discarded from calculating the reputation score (in addition to any punitive measures).This filter may become less effective as tools such as JoinMarket and confidential transactions are deployed.Reputation Score AlgorithmIrrespective of what pool of transaction summaries will be sampled for ratings, users or items will need to be sorted from most reputable to least reputable. The reputation score can be a contentious issue, but there are several factors to consider when selecting a reputation score algorithm. These factors are reviewed in this excellent article, and a slightly easier to understand version here.In short, OpenBazaar will use the lower bound of the Wilson score confidence interval, for a Bernoulli parameter, calculate the reputation score of a user. Incidentally, Reddit also uses this approach to rank stories.Third party services can collect transaction summaries, filter, and experiment with alternative algorithms to calculate the reputation score of a user.ConclusionTransaction summaries are units of reputation data in OpenBazaar. This data can be parsed in a variety of ways to either enhance the reputation score or form an alternative reputation score that is more relevant to a subset of users. Thus, OpenBazaar is a platform for developing decentralized reputation systems as well as for marketplaces.While most of these ideas will not be implemented in time for our upcoming release, they may serve as a foundation/inspiration for new contributors and/or third party developers to build on the reputation platform.Acknowledgements  Dionysis Zindros  Austin Williams  Chris Pacia  Dr David Strayhorn  Ian Grigg  Chrisopher Allen  Dr Bulukani Mlalazi",

                "content": "Decentralized reputation is one of the most sought after prizes in the cypherpunk community: to invent a censorship-resistant protocol to make and parse unforgeable trust relationships between pseudonymous identities. The problem is that trust and reputation are both abstract concepts that aggregate the subjective value judgements of unrelated experiences between people. Fundamentally, trust and reputation are highly contextual, and merely attributing a number or karma points to ascertain the overall trustworthiness of an identity is not very informative or useful. OpenBazaar’s reputation system is granular and contextual to trade that takes place within the network.  Granular in that ratings are made according to multiple criteria evaluating different components of an e-commerce transaction  Contextual in that ratings are made on a per-transaction basis, rather than goodwill pointsThe reputation of a user is the weighted-average of their transaction ratings. In summary, you cannot make a rating without showing evidence of a transaction over OpenBazaar. While we earlier explored the web of trust (WoT) model, the system described in this article is not a web of trust. OpenBazaar’s reputation system is similar to eBay and Taobao in that it is transaction-based. Where necessary, we have made some improvements that are described below. To get a sense of how the reputation system works, we must examine the following components in the OpenBazaar protocol:  Identity  Ricardian Contracts and the Trade Flow  Ratings and Reviews  Reputation ScoreThis article is adapted from slides we published earlier.  IdentityAny reputation system begins with a network of identities. In OpenBazaar, these identities are pseudonymous, which is to say that they are not inherently tied to your real world identity. The OpenBazaar network uses a Kademlia-style distributed hash table (DHT) to connect peers, similar to BitTorrent. Public key cryptography is used to generate a global unique identifier (GUID), which represents a pseudonymous node on the network. The GUID is a key that multiple values can be attributed to (e.g. an IP address and port). The key remains immutable (unchangeable) while the value is mutable (changeable). For example, Alice’s GUID on the OpenBazaar network remains constant even though her IP address/port changes depending on whether she connects to the network from home or work.1 GUID = 1 node on OpenBazaarIn OpenBazaar, a large random number (2^256) is initially generated, which is the private key of the GUID keypair. A corresponding public key is generated from the private key. The GUID is generated using a proof-of-work scheme to introduce computational difficulty in generating identities, to mitigate against a variety of sock-puppet attacks. With the target difficulty, GUID generation should take approximately 30 seconds. GUID = first 20 bytes of SHA256(self-signed public key), where the last 32 bytes &lt; a difficulty targetOpenBazaar uses Ed25519 for digital signatures.The GUID keys are used for:  Authenticating network messages between peers          GUID keys used for initial authentication      Ephemeral key pair generated to encrypt subsequent messages between peers for forward secrecy        Digitally signing Ricardian contracts          Digital agreements on the subject and terms of trade        Generate a hierarchical deterministic (HD) keychain for multisignature transactions          HD master private key = SHA256(GUID private key)       The GUID is the network identity of OpenBazaarThe GUID is long, complex, and prohibitively difficult for people to remember. Fortunately, we have added option support for Onename’s Blockchain ID to register an OpenBazaar GUID to a memorable handle (e.g. @drwasho). A Blockchain ID can also be associated with other real world and digital identities such as Facebook, Twitter, Github, or your PGP keys. This allows users to leverage their real world identities to build initial trust connections for trade. Alternatively, a user can not associate any real world identity with their Blockchain ID to preserve a purely pseudonymous identity. If a user registers their OpenBazaar GUID to a Blockchain ID handle, you will be able to search for that identity by that handle in the application. Future features include ‘sub-domain’ namespaces that can link to the same root identity, but map to different OpenBazaar GUIDs. Similarly, a user can acquire multiple handles that map to the same OpenBazaar GUID.  As an OpenBazaar identity is based on the generation of a cryptographic keypair, rather than divulging personally identifiable information, the user ultimately retains control over their privacy and can choose the level of association with their real world identity. Upon this foundation of identity we can begin to construct reputation based on transaction ratings.  Ricardian Contracts &amp; the Trade FlowRicardian contracts are simply digital documents that define the terms and conditions of an interaction, between two or more peers, which is cryptographically signed and verified. It is a tamper-proof contract that is formatted in XML or JSON and designed to be both human and machine readable. Ricardian contract have the following components:  Cryptographic keys to establish identity  Semantic data to establish the terms and conditions of an interaction (e.g. money exchanged for a good/service)  Digital signatures to create fraud-proof evidence that an identity agreed to these terms and conditions  Cryptographic hash of the contract, as a reference identifier, to create a tamper-proof record of the contractOpenBazaar extends the utility of the Ricardian contract, originally designed by the eminent Ian Grigg, to act as a ledger of the transaction or trade flow between the contracting parties. The final version of the Ricardian contract, with a completed and digitally signed record of the execution of the contract, is called a trade receipt. The data within the contract is signed with the GUID keys of the participants. OpenBazaar’s Ricardian contract schema for physical items:      The contract itself is broken up into the 4 stages of the trade flow: Stage 1: Listing/Vendor Offer  The Vendor lists what is for sale (physical item, digital content, services etc)  There are some prior steps regarding Moderator selection that won’t be elaborated on in this articleStage 2: Buyer Order  The Buyer sends an order to the Vendor  The Vendor acknowledges the order, sending a digital signature that will serve as a Vendor authentication of the order (prevents attackers from making fake ratings of the Vendor)  Buyer funds the multisignature escrow address  Order processing time begins: ~1-3 days to ship the itemStage 3: Vendor Order Confirmation  The Vendor confirms to the Buyer that the order has been processed and the item has been shipped  Gives the Buyer any shipping related data, for physical goods  Gives the Buyer a download address and password, for digital content  Gives the Buyer any relevant data to perform the service  Sends partially signed transaction releasing funds from the multisignature escrow address to the Vendor (still requires Buyer to sign after receiving the item)Stage 4: Buyer Receipt  Buyer acknowledges that the item, content, or service was delivered/performed  Signs a transaction releasing funds from multisignature escrow  Makes a rating and review of the Vendor, sends the transaction summary to the Vendor and Moderator for storageThere is more detail to each of these stages, but for the purpose of this article we’ll move on.  Ratings and ReviewsInitially, OpenBazaar will support ratings for Vendors (including the product/service they sell) and Moderators, who play a crucial role in the trust infrastructure of the network.We expect that in the early days of OpenBazaar’s release, Moderators will need to leverage their external reputation to gain trust from users on the network. This represents a unique opportunity for groups such as BitRated to extend their services into a decentralized markeplace.Rating a VendorAs mentioned earlier, the rating model for Vendors is comparable to eBay and TaoBao, and thus leverages the user experience most e-commerce users are familiar with.Vendors will be rated in 5 categories:  Feedback rating  Item/content/service quality  Item/content/service listing description  Item/content/service delivery  Customer serviceEach rating criteria will be rated out of 5 stars.Unlike eBay and TaoBao though, the meaning of these stars are not left open to subjective interpretation, but reflect an objective assessment criteria in order to more accurately standardize Buyer ratings.In addition to these ratings, the Buyer can also write a text review of the transaction.Feedback RatingWhat was the overall feedback when purchasing the product from the Vendor?  5 stars = I would do business with them again without hesitation.  4 stars = I will probably to do business with them again.  3 stars = I would only do business with them if I couldn’t find anyone else.  2 stars = I will not do business with them again.  1 star = This is a scam, avoid at all costs.Item/Content/Service QualityWhat was the quality of the item, content, or service from the vendor?  5 stars = I would purchase it again and recommend it to others without hesitation.  4 stars = I might purchase it again and recommend it, but I’d still look for alternatives first.  3 stars = I would only purchase and recommend it if I couldn’t find anything else like it first.  2 stars = I wouldn’t purchase it again or recommend it.  1 star = It is a scam, avoid this product.Item/Content/Service Listing DescriptionHow accurate was the listing description of the item, content or service?  5 stars = Perfectly accurate.  4 stars = Mostly accurate.  3 stars = Barely acceptable.  2 stars = Mostly inaccurate.  1 star = 100% false.Item/Content/Service DeliveryHow quickly was the item sent, content accessible, or service performed after ordering?  5 stars = Delivered earlier than the estimated delivery date.  4 stars = Delivered by the estimated delivery date.  3 stars = Delivered &lt;5 days later after the estimated delivery date.  2 stars = Delivered &gt;5 days after the estimated delivery date.  1 star = Never delivered.Customer ServiceHow do you rate the quality of the Vendor’s communication?  5 stars = The Vendor kept in contact with me at every stage of the trade. The Vendor answered my questions, clearly and concisely, &lt;12 hours after I asked.  4 stars = The Vendor only contacted me if there was a problem. The Vendor answered my questions, with some clarity, &lt;24 hours after I asked.  3 stars = The Vendor only contacted me after I reached out to them. The Vendor answered some questions, with passable clarity, &gt;24 hours after I asked.  2 stars = The Vendor rarely responded. The Vendor was not clear or understandable.  1 star = The Vendor never communicated.Text ReviewSimilar to eBay, written reviews have a size limit of 80 characters.Making a RatingRatings are made in the last stage of the trade flow (see above; Stage 4 Buyer Receipt). When a user receives an item, they need to confirm that the item was received in order to release funds from escrow to the Vendor. During that process, they will be asked to make a rating and write a text review as described above.While the data is stored within the trade receipt, it isn’t efficient (and doesn’t scale) to download a Vendor’s entire trade receipt history just to extract the rating and review data for that user (or for an item they sell).Instead of a trade receipt, Vendors will serve transaction summaries that contain the relevant data to validate a transaction and calculate the reputation score.The schema of a transaction summary is:{One of the most important elements of the transaction summary is the vendor’s signature of the transaction object, which contains the listing hash, bitcoin address, price etc. When the Buyer places the initial order with the Vendor, the Vendor’s client will send a digital signature of the transaction object. This will be a cryptographic proof of the Vendor’s involvement in the trade, which is necessary before any rating is made — otherwise a Vendor could refuse to attribute themselves to a transaction summary with a negative rating.The rest of data such as transaction ID (txid), the trade receipt hash, the rating and review text is added at the conclusion of the transaction and sent to the Vendor for their records. The transaction summary can also be sent to the Moderator for storage, in case the Vendor omits summaries with negative ratings.Overall, the transaction summary is a more compact proof of the Vendor and Buyer’s exchange and subsequent rating than the entire trade receipt. Future releases will address the issue of long term storage of transaction summaries and Vendor transparency, potentially with technologies such as Blockstore and/or IPFS.Rating a ModeratorRating a Moderator for their service is significantly more complex task. To our knowledge, it is entirely without precedent. Users should expect this area of reputation to evolve as we learn what transpires over the network in the years to come. Below we describe a system we feel comfortable launching and learning from.The task of Moderation is to pick a winning and losing side from a dispute between two parties (the Vendor and Buyer). Unfortunately, the rating of a Moderator will be heavily biased depending on whether the user has won or lost the dispute.In other words, if the Moderator decides that you are the winner in a dispute, you are more likely to rate the Moderator positively for their ‘wise and noble decision’. The opposite is true if you are on the losing side.As a result, OpenBazaar must show the rating/review — for each disputed transaction — from both sides. The goal is to highlight any potential agreement between the winner/loser in the rating criteria.Moderators will be rated in 4 categories:  Feedback Rating  Dispute Resolution Listing D__escription  Resolution Time  Customer ServiceAs with Vendors, each rating criteria will be rated out of 5 stars. Each star has an objective meaning that will be displayed to the user. Users can also submit a text review of the Moderator.Feedback RatingWhat was the overall feedback to the Moderator?  5 stars = I would choose them again without hesitation.  4 stars = I will probably do business with them again.  3 stars = I would only do business with them if I couldn’t find anyone ​better.  2 stars = I will not do business with them again.  1 star = This is a scam, avoid at all costs.Dispute resolution listing descriptionHow accurate was the Moderator’s dispute resolution description service?  5 stars = Perfectly.  4 stars = Mostly accurate.  3 stars = Barely acceptable.  2 stars = Mostly inaccurate.  1 star = 100% false.Dispute resolution timeHow quickly was the dispute resolved by the Moderator?  5 stars = Resolved earlier than the estimated time.  4 stars = Resolved earlier the estimated time.  3 stars = Resolved &lt;5 days later after the estimated time.  2 stars = Delivered &gt;5 days after the estimated time.  1 star = Never delivered.Customer ServiceHow do you rate the quality of the Moderator’s communication?  5 stars = The Moderator kept in contact with me and answered my questions, clearly and concisely, &lt;12 hours after I asked.  4 stars = The Moderator only contacted me if they had a specific question/resquest from me. The Moderator answered my questions, with some clarity, &lt;24 hours after I asked.  3 stars = The Moderator only contacted me after I reached out to them. The Vendor answered some questions, with passable clarity, &gt;24 hours after I asked.  2 stars = The Moderator rarely responded. The Moderator was not clear or understandable.  1 star = The Vendor never communicated.Text ReviewWritten reviews have a size limit of 80 characters.Making a RatingBroadly speaking, there are 2 classes of dispute that may arise:  The Buyer failing to release funds from escrow  The Buyer being unsatisfied with the contents or delivery of the itemDispute: The Buyer failing to release funds from escrowThis scenario will be due to the Buyer being incapacitated or forgetting to release funds. If the Buyer fails to respond after a reasonable number of attempts over time, the Moderator will collaborate with the Vendor to release the funds.This process is initiated by the Vendor, who flags a dispute to the Moderator and Buyer (if online). To flag the dispute, the Vendor sends the dispute claim (with a digital signature) to the Moderator and Buyer:  The hash of the transaction object  Who the claimant is (i.e. the Vendor in this example)  The written claim (80 characters long)If the Buyer fails to respond to the Moderator, the Moderator will issue their resolution. The resolution, digitally signed by the Moderator, will include:  The hash of the dispute claim  The written resolution outcome and justification (character length to be decided)The resolution is then sent to both the Vendor and Buyer (if online) and a transaction releasing the funds from escrow to the Vendor is created and signed.A transaction summary is automatically generated at the end of this process, as described earlier, that also includes the dispute claim, the resolution, and the Moderator review.Both the Vendor and Moderator will host and serve this transaction summary to other users.Vendor transaction summary{Dispute: The Buyer being unsatisfied with the contents or delivery of the itemThis dispute will arise if the Buyer claims that the item was not delivered or if the item delivered was incorrect, damaged, or significantly different from the product description. Whatever the circumstance, the Buyer will be attempting to obtain a full refund.Typically, the Buyer will be the one to initiate a dispute and submit a dispute claim to the Moderator and Buyer. After this step, most of the dispute resolution process will transpire over the internal messaging channel we have built into OpenBazaar, which is encrypted with the participants’ public keys.After the Moderator has come to a decision to who the winning party is, they will issue a resolution as described above.When the funds are finally released from escrow to the winning party, both the Buyer and Vendor can generate a transaction summary. Here they will both have an opportunity to rate the Moderator on the dispute resolution. The Buyer’s transaction summary will also have the rating/review of the Vendor, which may not be counted in the final reputation score of the Vendor if the Buyer lost the dispute.The Moderator will host the transaction summaries from both parties, which will be available for users to inspect.Buyer transaction summary{  “tx_summary” : {      “vendor” : {        “guid” : “”,        “pubkey” : “”      },      “transaction” : {        “listing” : “”,        “bitcoin_address” : “”,        “price” : “”,        “buyer_pubkey” : “”,        “moderator_guid” : “”,        “moderator_pubkey” : “”      },      “vendor_tx_signature” : “”,      “txid” : “”,      “trade_receipt_hash160” : “”,      “dispute” : {        “transaction_hash160” : “”,        “claimant” : “”,        “claim” : “”      },      “claimant_signature” : “”,      “moderator_resolution” : {        “dispute_hash160” : “”,        “summary” : “”      },      “moderator_signature” : “”,      “vendor_rating” : {        “feedback”: 0,        “quality” : 0,        “description” : 0,        “delivery_time” : 0,        “customer_service” : 0,        “review” : “”      },      “moderator_rating” : {        “feedback” : 0,        “description” : 0,        “time” : 0,        “customer_service” : 0,        “review” : “”      }  },  “buyer_signature” : “”}Vendor transaction summary{  “tx_summary” : {      “vendor” : {        “guid” : “”,        “pubkey” : “”      },      “transaction” : {        “listing” : “”,        “bitcoin_address” : “”,        “price” : “”,        “buyer_pubkey” : “”,        “moderator_guid” : “”,        “moderator_pubkey” : “”      },      “vendor_tx_signature” : “”,      “txid” : “”,      “trade_receipt_hash160” : “”,      “dispute” : {        “transaction_hash160” : “”,        “claimant” : “”,        “claim” : “”      },      “claimant_signature” : “”,      “moderator_resolution” : {        “dispute_hash160” : “”,        “summary” : “”      },      “moderator_signature” : “”,      “moderator_rating” : {        “feedback” : 0,        “description” : 0,        “time” : 0,        “customer_service” : 0,        “review” : “”      }  },  “vendor_signature” : “”}Reputation ScoreThe reputation score of a Vendor is the average feedback rating from all of their transactions. A user can expand the reputation score to see a Vendor’s average ratings for item quality, listing description, delivery time, and customer service.The reputation scores of a Moderator are the average feedback ratings from the winning and losing sides of disputed transactions. As with the Vendors, the average ratings for each criteria can be expanded from both sides.ChallengesTo put it plainly, no reputation system is resistant to a Vendor purchasing their own items and making false-positive ratings.This is especially true of a pseudonymous decentralized marketplace, where Buyer identities are - by default - undisclosed. Even a web-of-trust model, which is excellent at detecting suspicious islands of ‘reputable’ users, will not be able to distinguish between real and fake ratings of a Vendor. Why? As discussed, Buyer identities are not disclosed in the transaction summaries (unlike trade receipts, which is necessary for dispute resolution); Buyers are only represented by a bitcoin address. This is the equivalent of a single-use pseudonymous identity that would be the cause of suspicion in a web-of-trust model. As the GUID is directly mapped to the IP address (DHT), disclosing the GUID may compromise the real world privacy and security of the Buyer (as well as their spending habits).That said, a web-of-trust graph based off transaction summaries _where the Buyer is known (i.e. the GUID and Blockchain ID is _voluntarily disclosed) would be a useful tool.As transaction ratings in OpenBazaar must be tied to a bitcoin transaction, there is a cost - albeit a small one - to making a rating. Furthermore, the bitcoin transaction graph may emerge as a useful filter to assess/score the legitimacy of a transaction rating. For example, if an attacking Vendor uses the same coins to make 100 transactions in order to create 100 transaction ratings, this can be easily spotted with little analytical sophistication. There are many opportunities for third parties to build entire services on assessing the reputation of a Vendor.The FutureA reputation system within OpenBazaar may facilitate the emergence of new types of markets to be supported on the network. The reputation of a Vendor may be used to assess the risk associated with that identity for loans or insurance policies issued over OpenBazaar. This is an fascinating subject that we’ll be exploring in future articles.Going forward, past the initial release, will be the development of:  Asynchronous ordering and network message caching Needs to be compatible with the rating system  Rating system for Buyers? Is there any value in implementing a rating system for Buyers, or would this lead to a negative rating Mexican standoff? Final ThoughtsOpenBazaar doesn’t claim to create or try to create a global decentralized reputation system for everything. What we have designed is a highly contextual rating system, similar to the standard e-commerce experience (with some improvements in our view), which will establish Vendor and Moderator reputations. The latter is really breaking new ground, which will undoubtedly be the subject of revision after seeing it run in the wild.Finally, the transaction rating data can be parsed by third party developers to analyse and calculate the reputation scores according to the other approaches such as the Bayesian average. A high priority for future releases will be the long-term distributed free storage of transaction summaries.",

No one person is in control. There’s no single computer server to shut down, no dragon’s head to chop off.” Only one problem: OpenBazaar is not an underground marketplace. Those marketplaces were built specifically for illicit goods, and rely on technology (such as Tor) which obfuscates identity online. OpenBazaar is entirely different. It’s a decentralized platform, not controlled by anyone, and not run for profit. It’s not being built for any subset of trade, but gives anyone in the world the power to buy and sell any type of goods and services with anyone else. It doesn’t use Tor or any tool to obfuscate identity. 2. “But now police are starting to see marketplaces like OpenBazaar. It’s a peer-to-peer operation, just sellers and buyers. There’s no kingpin to arrest. Europol compares OpenBazaar to BitTorrent, where people trade pirated movies and music.” Police are not starting to see marketplaces like OpenBazaar, because OpenBazaar hasn’t launched yet. In the Europol report OpenBazaar is briefly mentioned under the “Future Threats and Developments” section. They clearly refer to OpenBazaar as “emerging technology.” 3. “The fight against OpenBazaar is going just about as well as the fight against illegally copied media (not well).” This claim is a complete fabrication. There is no “fight against OpenBazaar” or any conflict between the marketplace and law enforcement at all, for several reasons. The most obvious reason is that it’s impossible, since OpenBazaar hasn’t launched yet. Equally important is the point that OpenBazaar isn’t an underground marketplace at all, and law enforcement has no more reason to “fight against OpenBazaar” as they have to fight against any other online platform. In fact, this one bullet point is the entire extent of the recommentations the Eurpol report had regarding OpenBazaar:  “Law enforcement should collaborate with private sector andacademia to explore investigative and research opportunitiesrelated to emerging technologies such as decentralised marketplaces like OpenBazaar.”CNN took a brief mention of OpenBazaar in a Europol report and turned it into a false narrative of law enforcement against decentralized markets. There is no conflict. OpenBazaar exists to eliminate the middleman from ecommerce, taking fees down to 0% and allowing people to trade directly with each other online. The world doesn’t have a standard protocol for trading goods and services online, nor does it have a network to share information about those goods and services. OpenBazaar finally creates a protocol and network that is free and open for all. As such, we expect that the use of OpenBazaar will largely reflect how society trades at large - almost entirely legitimate, positive trade with a small portion of people using it for illicit activity. We’re excited to see - once we’ve actually launched - how people will use OpenBazaar to make their own lives better.",

                "title": "Digital Assets in OpenBazaar", 
                "content": "Digital assets are obligations to real-world items, content, or services that are digitally recorded. Digital assets are issued by individuals or corporations, and the bearers of the assets are entitled to the obligation promised by the issuer. In simple terms, they are the digital equivalent of a poker chip in a casino, redeemable for cash at the end of a game. To make digital assets immutable and unforgeable, they are issued and transferred over Bitcoin’s blockchain as transactional metadata and is associated with a unique Bitcoin address. Using public key encryption, only the private key associated with that address can be used to authenticate and receive a digital asset obligation. Digital assets can be used in a number of different ways. Here are three concrete examples:  Gold certificates          The bearer can redeem physical ounces of gold from a depository institution after proving ownership of the address through a digital signature        Keys          A electronically-activated lock can be triggered on/off only with the digital signature from the private key of the digital asset bearer      After selling the car, the digital asset is transferred to the new owner’s address; the lock will now exclusively respond to the new owner        Coupons and Gift Certificates          The bearer can digitally sign a message to claim a shopping discount or gift certificate issued by a Vendor      The applications of digital assets are limited by a combination of tools and creativity. Over the past several years, the tools and protocols to create and transfer digital assets have matured. Presently there are three major digital asset protocols (not counting metacoin/altcoin-based protocols):  Open Assets  CoinSpark   Colored coins [caption id=”attachment_578” align=”aligncenter” width=”648”] Transaction share covers the past week[/caption] These protocols generally share the same approach: [caption id=”” align=”aligncenter” width=”646”] Generalised Digital Asset Protocol[/caption] Bitcoin transactions make use of OP_RETURN to embed metadata to create or transfer digital assets to an output(s). These outputs can be audited for transactions on the blockchain to determine who the rightful owner of a digital asset is and how much of it they have.  The BottleneckThe challenge with digital assets is discovery and security (i.e. secured vs unsecured loan). In the gold certificate example, how do I find gold certificates to purchase, with the intention of taking delivery of physical ounces at some later date? How does the buyer know that the issuer of gold certificates will deliver physical ounces to the bearer? Is the depository institution reputable? Can I purchase gold certificates at a lower premium from someone else? All of these questions are solved by OpenBazaar.  Selling Digital Assets over OpenBazaarThe core of OpenBazaar is a combination of the following components:  A contracting platform          Allows a buyer and seller to lock in the terms of trade for the transfer of a digital asset via a Ricardian contract.        A discovery network          Permits users to scan the distributed peer-to-peer network for users selling digital assets you’re interested in.        A marketplace for dispute resolution          Empowers contracting users to find a reputable agent to resolve any potential disputes, or release locked funds in escrow if one is unresponsive or incapacitated.        A distributed reputation system          Allows users to assess the transactional history and ratings of a Vendor within OpenBazaar.        Bitcoin for payments          Enables rapid and global payments as well as a powerful escrow system to prevent any one person from stealing funds.      For issuers to sell their digital assets, they would firstly need to create a listing or ‘ask order’ on their node. Listings are simply JSON-formatted text files that fit the properties of a Ricardian contract, which are parsed and formatted in a user-friendly interface for buyers. The Ricardian contract schema for selling physical items, digital content (e.g. music), or services is not well suited for listing digital assets. As a result, we have created a new contract schema to list digital assets for sale. [caption id=”” align=”aligncenter” width=”377”] Listing Schema for the Digital Asset in the Ricardian Contract.[/caption] Schema objects:  Issuance          Boolean value to indicate whether the contract is issuing a digital asset or not        Asset          ID - what is the identity of the digital asset (typically defined by the protocol used to create it)      Source - the transaction ID and bitcoin address that the digital asset is associated with, as well as the protocol used to issue/transfer the asset      Properties - the schema nested within this object would be unique to the type of the digital asset; in the above example, the schema is for an equity security (i.e. stocks)        Quantity          Number of units of the digital asset to be transferred        Price per asset          Bitcoin - if the digital asset is to be priced in bitcoin directly      Fiat - if the digital asset is to be priced in fiat, the seller needs to identity the fiat currency and price (at the time of sale, the necessary quantity of bitcoin will be calculated based on the exchange rate)      As with all Ricardian contracts in OpenBazaar, each stage of the trade flow will be signed using the Seller and Buyer GUID keys. Trade Flow for Digital Assets  The Seller creates a listing for the digital asset (equivalent of an ask order)  Buyer sends a purchase order to the Seller          The order includes an unsigned transaction      Transaction has n inputs and 1 output to send the purchase amount of the digital asset to the Seller        The Seller acknowledges the order and replies with a signed transaction          The Seller adds two components to the unsigned transaction:                  1 input from their digital asset address, transferring the equivalent of a miner’s fee to the Buyer’s new digital asset address          An OP_RETURN output embedded with data (recognized by a specific digital asset protocol) releasing assets to the Buyer’s digital asset address                      The Buyer receives the transaction, signs it, and broadcasts it to the networkFinal state: the funds are released to the Seller, and the digital asset is transferred to the Buyer. Note that for direct exchanges of Bitcoin for a digital asset, no multisignature escrow is required as a single transaction with multiple inputs and outputs can simultaneously fund the Seller and transfer the digital asset to the Buyer.  Securitized Digital AssetsEvery digital asset has an underlying value it represents. A gold certificate - it is a promise to redeem physical ounces of gold. A gift certificate - any items purchased at a store up to a certain value. A concert ticket - the price of admission to the concert. For the digital asset holder, they must have trust in issuer to fulfill their obligation. For large and reputable institutions that are legally accessible, a Buyer may feel comfortable trusting their counterparty. However, this approach means that smaller institutions or pseudonymous individuals are unlikely to solicit enough trust from potential buyers. One possible solution is to secure (financially) these digital assets by placing the purchase amount in multisignature escrow. This way, a Buyer can be refunded if the issuer fails to deliver on their obligation. This comes with a trade-off to digital asset liquidity, and therefore may only be practical to certain high value digital assets where trust is low and risk is high. Alternatively, if a Moderator is involved in the transaction, they can purchase the escrow amount (to be released in the future) for a discounted present value. For example:  Alice purchases 1 BTC worth of gold as a digital asset from Bob  Charlie (the Moderator) sell 0.9 BTC to Bob in exchange for the 1 BTC in escrow to be released in the future  Bob gets the funds immediately, while Charlie makes a profit at a later time pointThis scenario breaks down if Bob fails to deliver any gold to Alice, defaulting on his obligation that triggers a refund to Alice. As a result, Charlie is taking a risk with this approach for the chance for profit, all the while Alice is protected.  When will it be ready?We aim to release a completely overhauled version of the client in the next few months that is focused on e-commerce (physical items, digital content, and services). Shortly after this, we will be progressively adding support to new types of Ricardian contracts and their corresponding trade flows to expand the use-cases of OpenBazaar. If you’re a developer who wants to see this vision completed sooner rather than later, get in touch with us at project [at] openbazaar dot org or join our community in Slack.     Written by: Dr Washington Sanchez (drwasho)   Special thanks to:  Amos Meiri  Ian Grigg  Austin Williams",

Through the beta releases, users ran all the code in the single repository, which contained the networking, Bitcoin handling and user interface together. Front and back end weren’t separate. Now that we are rebuilding OpenBazaar from the ground up, we’ve decided to take a different approach. Our new code based is split into three repositories; OpenBazaar-Server, OpenBazaar-Client, and OpenBazaar-Installer. This separates our back end entirely from the client. Users will now be able to run an OpenBazaar server alone without needing the client. The client can be directed to an OpenBazaar server that isn’t run locally. This also allows for new clients to be built other than the OpenBazaar reference client. This modular approach, together with the APIs, will also make mobile implementation simpler.OpenBazaar-ServerThis repository manages the back end: The p2p networking; creation, signing and verification of the Ricardian contracts; and management of multisig Bitcoin keys. This repository is the furthest along in development and we could use review on it now, especially the networking portion.OpenBazaar-ClientThis repository manages the front end and is the reference client for the project. It uses both a websocket and REST API to talk to the server. This repository is currently taking the client prototype and implementing it. It should be ready for basic review within the next week.OpenBazaar-InstallerThis repository manages the installation of the other two repositories.

Since OpenBazaar began in April of 2014, it’s been a group of volunteers all over the world contributing spare time to push out new releases every few months. Altogether we put out five releases, and the fifth of these is what is in our github repo right now. It is usable, but still has bugs and isn’t ready for real commerce yet. Now that several of the core devs (myself included) have formed a company and received funding, we’re changing our approach to development. We won’t be doing incremental releases every few months, but instead put out a larger version 1 release later this year. Here’s what the roadmap looks like.  This allows us, along with the community, to completely rework the networking, DHT, and UI. This process is well underway. Chris and Nikolas of OB1 have released two new libraries for review already, one is for the DHT and the other is the UDP networking. Mike Wolf is working on the UInow. Since we have limited time and resources, we’re dedicating it all towards making the new release something incredible. This means that issues that arise with the existing code and network won’t be resolved, apart from minor maintenance such as keeping the seed servers running. Testers are still free to run the existing code, but we won’t be making changes to the UI or fixing anything other than catastrophic bugs. As always, we’re happy to review pull requests to either the existing or the new code. We will make sure to release new code as soon as possible to allow for testing the new client and networking. One part of this project that I’ve loved is having folks try out the code in real time and see what works and what doesn’t, often talking over IRC or Slack (which you can join here). This is still very important, and we’ll let everyone know as soon as we have new code to test out.",

                "content": "The OpenBazaar core team is excited to announce that we’ve received $1 million in seed funding from Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, and angel investor William Mougayar to develop the OpenBazaar protocol and client, and build the first business on top of the OpenBazaar network. The OpenBazaar project was launched in April 2014 and received vocal support from the bitcoin community, who share our vision for a free and decentralized ecommerce platform using bitcoin. OpenBazaar is ambitiously combining several technologies including peer-to-peer networking, Ricardian contracts, decentralized reputation, and multisignature escrow for bitcoin payments. Despite our best efforts as part-time volunteers, progress was slow. The project needed the core contributors to make development a full-time effort in order to release a robust application within a reasonable time-frame. This funding allows us to commit our full-time resources to develop OpenBazaar. Not only will it allow us to work with the community to finish the first full release of the core protocol and application, but it also gives us the opportunity to create the first business on top of the OpenBazaar network. This business, which we’ve named OB1, will offer services to OpenBazaar users, and aims to bootstrap adoption of decentralized commerce. OpenBazaar will always be open source and MIT licensed. As a global software community, we’ve intentionally created OpenBazaar so that there are no fees required to use the network, and there is no central authority controlling trade, taking a cut, or monitoring data. As a result, companies such as OB1 cannot act as a central authority on the network. OB1 will aid decentralized commerce by offering services such as dispute resolution, store hosting, and more. With their history of helping build networks with large user bases and their focus on new decentralized technologies such as bitcoin, Union Square Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz are the perfect partners to help OpenBazaar become widely adopted. William Mougayar is a board member as well as angel investor, and brings many years of experience in startups to our team. OpenBazaar—aided by OB1—can become the platform which makes decentralized commerce online a reality. If the bitcoin community joins us in developing the code further, testing new releases, and adopting it on release, we will succeed. OpenBazaar has always been community-driven, and the OB1 team will be an important part of the community. But it will only be a part - we’ll follow up this post with another from other OpenBazaar community members. We’ll all work together to make trade free.The OB1 Team - Brian, Chris, Mike, Nikolas, Sam and Washington       Press Release and Images OpenBazaar Team Raises $1M from USV and A16Z to Make Trade FreeInvites a Growing Global Community of Developers to Contribute and Get InvolvedWashington, DC, – June 11, 2015 - The core developers of the OpenBazaar project announced today they’ve received a $1 million round of seed funding from Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and angel investor William Mougayar that will help fuel their vision of making trade free for everyone, everywhere. “The Internet has decentralized communications, and Bitcoin has decentralized money, but online commerce still relies on numerous intermediaries,” says Brian Hoffman, the project lead. “OpenBazaar removes the intermediaries and gives everyone – individuals to large companies – the ability to directly engage in trade with anyone in the world, for free.” OpenBazaar is an open source project, started in April 2014, which uses software to create a decentralized network of buyers and sellers who offer their goods and services directly to each other. The project via GitHub has captured the attention of nearly 1,400 developers worldwide, with about 100 developers having contributed code. Because the network isn’t centrally controlled, there are no listing or transaction fees, ability to monitor and capture user data, or restrict trade in any way. Unlike many ecommerce platforms and their corresponding payment processors, OpenBazaar can be used anywhere in the world with Bitcoin. The funding will enable several of the core developers to work full time on further developing the platform, which is currently in its fifth beta release. It will also allow them to create the first company built on the network – named OB1 – which will offer services to OpenBazaar users. Union Square Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz have both invested previously in startups in the Bitcoin space, as well as online marketplaces. William Mougayar, angel investor and board member, is participating in the round and brings decades of ecommerce and startup experience to the team. “USV is excited to support and help OpenBazaar and OB1 realize their vision of delivering a free and open marketplace protocol that ushers in a new era of peer to peer global commerce.” OpenBazaar is encouraging those interested in this groundbreaking project to find out more and get involved by joining the developer community on GitHub (http://github.com/OpenBazaar) or through their public Slack by requesting an invitation at project@openbazaar.org.

For the fourth beta release, we’re issuing guides for each of the three user types in OpenBazaar: buyer, merchant, and notary. The installation instructions are the same for each user. These guides assume that installation was successful and that the user can reach the client interface in their browser. If you can’t, please check the Github issues and our Help Desk to see if it’s a known issue; if not then open a new issue on the Github or ask a question at our Help Desk.Quick Start GuideThis guide is meant to get notaries set up and offering their services to buyers and merchants as quickly as possible. For a detailed overview of the entire client, visit here.Step One: Personalize your Client  Click the Settings tab.  Enter a new Nickname for yourself. This is how other users will see you.  If you want a unique image for your avatar, put in a URL for an image in the Avatar URL field.  Input a Bitcoin address that you control into the Bitcoin Receiving Address field. This is where you receive funds from multisig if your services are needed.  Click Save.Step Two: Set Communication Information  Click on the Communication section.  Enter an email address if you want to communicate with other parties via email.  If you have a website that you want displayed, enter the URL in the Your Web Site field.  Enter a Bitmessage address if you want to communicate with other parties via Bitmessage.  Click Save.Step Three: Create Backup  Click on the Backup section.  Click Create New Backup.Step Four: Set up your Notary DetailsIn Settings, select the Notary section.  Make me a notary. By clicking Yes in this section, you allow others to choose you as a notary. They will see this option when they click on your store front and see the “Services” tab, or by manually entering your GUID into the Trusted Notaries section. The default option is set to No; users aren’t notaries unless they choose to be.  Fees. As a notary, you can charge a percentage fee for providing dispute resolution. If the buyer and seller finish their transaction without needing the notary, there is no payment. If the notary is needed to refund buyer or release payment to merchant, then they will receive the percentage from the multisig that they set in this section. A notaries’ fee is visible in the “Services” tab in their store front.  Description of your services. Notaries can explain their terms and conditions in this area, as well as their credentials and any other information they wish to share.Step Five: Manage your OrdersNote that at this point, offering notary services means you automatically accept all transactions which choose you as a notary. In the future, notaries will be able to screen transactions, or only accept them manually. If a buyer or seller contacts a notary asking for funds to be released, it’s the notary’s responsibility to do their best to determine which party should receive funds. Once they’ve made their decision and contacted the parties, they can release funds by opening up the order in the notarizations tab.  In the 0.4 client, the notary has two options. “Refund the Buyer” releases all the funds from multisig to the buyer, minus the percentage fee which is paid to the notary for dispute resolution. “Release money to the Merchant” does the same for the merchant. The notary must click “Send Resolution” for the transaction to process.Step Six: Give FeedbackTo make this network and client the best it can be, we need your feedback on how to improve. Bug reports are obviously very helpful, but feedback can be about which new features you’d like to see, or changes to the interface, or anything you like.

If someone purchases your product, the item will display “Buyer Paid.” Please double check the linked multisig account in the order description to verify; at this point a buyer can mark an item as paid without actually paying.4.  Determine if you trust the notary involved. Since at this point the buyer chooses the notary, if the two parties are colluding, they can cheat you out of the Bitcoin. You can view the notary involved by clicking “Contract Details” in the item description. Early in the beta, we recommend test transactions or small transactions until trusted notaries become established.  If you verify the buyer has sent the funds to multisig, and that you trust the notary, then ship the item to the buyer at the address they provided. This address is displayed in the “Shipping Information” tab when viewing the order.  Once you’ve shipped the item, input your Bitcoin address into the Shipping &amp; Payment section of the order view, where it asks “Where would you like payment sent to?”  Once the buyer receives the item, they should release payment. If they don’t in a reasonable time, contact the buyer and request they release funds.

Store Info  Keys  Communication  Notary  Advanced  BackupStore InfoIn the Store Info section, you have the following options.Store Details  Nickname. This is the name of your store that everyone will see on the network. You must enter a store name or it will display as “Default.”  Avatar URL. This allows you to choose a personalized image which is displayed along with your store. These images are externally hosted, so choose a link to an image of your choice. Avatars are optional.  Namecoin id. If you have a Namecoin id, you can choose to have it displayed in your profile.  Bitcoin Receiving Address. It is important you put in a Bitcoin address that you control. This is where funds will be released if the third party notary needs to manually release funds from multisig.  Store Description. Give a short description of your store here. Only supports text at the moment.Reputation PledgeThis section displays the amount of your reputation pledge, and your proof-of-burn address. Reputation pledges are a way to intentionally burn a small amount of Bitcoin tied to your store ID in order to show others you are committed to maintaining your store reputation. In other words, someone who has made a sizeable reputation pledge is unlikely to be a scammer, since it wouldn’t be profitable for a scammer to consistently burn coins for new identities. You can learn more about reputation pledges here. Note that during betas we don’t recommend large reputation pledges, since there’s a good chance your store may need to be updated and you will lose the identity associated with the pledge. To make a pledge, simply send a small amount of Bitcoin to the address listed as “Proof-of-burn address.”Shipping InformationThis is where a buyer will input their shipping information. If you intend on using OpenBazaar as a buyer as well as a merchant, you should fill this section out as well.KeysBitcoin Public Key (Uncompressed)This is the uncompressed Bitcoin public key created for signing.BIP32 SeedThe OpenBazaar client uses BIP32 to create HD keys for signing. This increases privacy by ensuring that the same key isn’t used for signing multisignature transactions. This seed should be kept private.PGP Public KeyIn order to encrypt communications over the network, each store creates a PGP key pair. This is the public key which other users’ clients use to encrypt messages sent to you.Communication  Email. If you’d like to communicate with other users over email, set it here. Your email will be visible to anyone viewing your store.  Your Website. If you’d like to have your website URL displayed in your store, set it here.  Bitmessage. If you’d like to communicate with other users over Bitmessage, set it here.NotaryNotaries are a vital part of OpenBazaar. They are the third key holder in the 2 of 3 multisig, meaning that if there is a dispute between buyer and merchant, only the notary has the power to work with one of the parties to release the funds. As such, it’s important that buyer and merchant trust the notary not to collude with the other party. In beta we recommend smaller transactions until reputable notaries emerge in the market. Since in the 0.4 beta buyers choose notaries, the burden is on the merchant to either accept the buyer’s choice of notary or contact the buyer and notary to tell them you don’t want to engage in trade with the other parties.Trusted NotariesThis is a list of notaries that you’ve trusted. You can also add a notary manually by entering their GUID (the string of numbers and letters under their store name).Notary DetailsThis section is for notaries to set up their services.  Make me a notary. By clicking Yes in this section, you allow others to choose you as a notary. They will see this option when they click on your store front and see the “Services” tab, or by manually entering your GUID into the Trusted Notaries section. The default option is set to No; users aren’t notaries unless they choose to be.  Fees. As a notary, you can charge a percentage fee for providing dispute resolution. If the buyer and seller finish their transaction without needing the notary, there is no payment. If the notary is needed to refund buyer or release payment to merchant, then they will receive the percentage from the multisig that they set in this section. A notaries’ fee is visible in the “Services” tab in their store front.  Description of your services. Notaries can explain their terms and conditions in this area, as well as their credentials and any other information they wish to share.AdvancedObelisk ServerThis allows the user to manually select an Obelisk (libbitcoin) server.Developer ToolsThese allow the user to clear their cache, clear the peers stored in the database, and to stop their own node.LogThe log can be used for troubleshooting and bug reports.BackupsYou can create new backups with the “Create New Backup” button, and they will be displayed below the Backup Name section.HomeThe Home tab displays Other Markets, allows the user to search for products, and serves as a simple place to communicate via the Chat Stream.Other Markets You can view the other stores connected to you by clicking on them. Stores with a checkmark should be visible. Stores with an X were visible once, but are now offline. The client should automatically pull in new stores as they become available, but occasionally refreshing the page may help. When viewing a store, there are three sections.  Store. This displays the merchant’s products. Clicking on the image displays more details.  Details. This displays information about the merchant, including their OB public key, PGP key, amount of their reputation pledge, and any communication information they’ve displayed.  Services. This is only visible if the user offers notary services. If they do, it will display their percentage fee, a description of their services, and allow users to select them as notaries by clicking “Make Trusted Notary.”Users can also contact the store owner by selecting the “Message me” or “Email me” buttons in blue underneath their name.SearchWhen creating an item, merchants tag them with keywords. Buyers can then use the search bar to find items tagged with those keywords. Clicking on an item brings the users to the merchant’s store front.Chat StreamThis is a simple chat that any node can use to communicate with all other nodes it is connected to. Note that this feature isn’t likely to scale well and will be removed in future releases.Purchasing a Product If you click on an item in a store, a new window opens to give more product details, including the product title, price in Bitcoin, product description, cost of shipping and handling, quantity available, the item’s condition, and up to three photos. There is also a “Raw Contract” button which allows users to view the contract details directly.  Clicking on “Order Details” on the bottom left will bring you to a screen that allows you to purchase the product. You can determine the quantity desired, and attach a comment for the merchant to see along with your order. If you haven’t entered your shipping address in Settings already, a red warning will ask you to do so before proceeding. The price for the product and shipping and handling are displayed again. At the bottom the user needs to input a Bitcoin Address that they control. This will be used in case of a refund. Once this section is completed, the user selects “Choose a Notary.” A list of online notaries that the user has trusted is displayed. If the user hasn’t trusted any notaries, or if none of those notaries are online, they must choose another notary in order to continue. The user then completes the order by selecting “Submit Order.” This sends the order to the notary and merchant.Contracts The contracts tab is where a merchant manages their products. The merchant can create new contracts, edit existing contracts, or delete them.Add Contract  Click on the Contract tab.  Click Add Contract.  Input product details, including a title and description of your product, as well as the price (in Bitcoin), the cost of shipping, how many items are available, and what condition the items are in.  Add up to three externally hosted images in the photos section.  Make sure you click on the Keyword section next to Photos and input keywords that describe your product. This is how users find your items through the search function. If you don’t add keywords, your items cannot be found via search.  Click Save. This publishes your product to the network.OrdersThe orders tab keeps track of the activity of buyers and merchants through the “My Sales” and “My Purchases” sections.My SalesIf a merchant has a sale, the details of that sale are listed here. An order number is created, along with the time and date of the purchase and the buyer’s details.  A merchant should take the following steps once they’ve received an order.  Click on the order to display details.  If someone purchases your product, the item will display “Buyer Paid.” Please double check the linked multisig account in the order description to verify; at this point a buyer can mark an item as paid without actually paying.4.  Determine if you trust the notary involved. Since at this point the buyer chooses the notary, if the two parties are colluding, they can cheat you out of the Bitcoin. You can view the notary involved by clicking “Contract Details” in the item description. Early in the beta, we recommend test transactions or small transactions until trusted notaries become established.  If you verify the buyer has sent the funds to multisig, and that you trust the notary, then ship the item to the buyer at the address they provided. This address is displayed in the “Shipping Information” tab when viewing the order.  Once you’ve shipped the item, input your Bitcoin address into the Shipping &amp; Payment section of the order view, where it asks “Where would you like payment sent to?”  Once the buyer receives the item, they should release payment. If they don’t in a reasonable time, contact the buyer and request they release funds. If they are non-responsive, contact the notary involved in the transaction and request they release funds.My PurchasesWhen a buyer views “My Purchases” it will display the status of their orders. If they’ve just submitted an order, the status will indicate “Need to Pay” and the buyer needs to open the order to complete payment.  A QR code is displayed which, if scanned, will input the multisignature address and amount. If the user selects “Pay in your Wallet,” it will open a wallet on their device and pull in the same information. Once the payment is completed, the buyer must manually select “Mark as Paid.” This lets the merchant know to ship the item. If the buyer marked the order as paid, but the merchant didn’t receive this message due to being offline, the buyer can re-open the order and click on “Resend Payment Notice” when the merchant is online. Once the item has arrived or service is provided, the buyer can then release the funds from multisig by opening the order and selecting “Release Payment to Merchant.” Again, if the merchant didn’t receive this message due to being offline, the buyer can try releasing again when they are online.NotarizationsNotaries manage their orders through the notarizations tab. This is the same as the My Purchases and My Sales tabs, except it tracks the contracts which the notary has been selected for. Note that at this point, offering notary services means you automatically accept all transactions which choose you as a notary. In the future, notaries will be able to screen transactions, or only accept them manually. If a buyer or seller contacts a notary asking for funds to be released, it’s the notary’s responsibility to do their best to determine which party should receive funds.

The notary must click “Send Resolution” for the transaction to process.Messages The messages tab is a place to communicate with other OpenBazaar users who are online. You can send simple messages (text only at this point) by clicking the “Send a Message” button and selecting another user from the dropdown list. Messages you’ve received can be read by clicking on them, and replied to by hitting the blue “Reply” button on the right.Terminal CommandsFor Linux and OSX users, you need to use the terminal to configure, start, and stop OpenBazaar. Here are some common commands to use.  ./configure.sh This installs OpenBazaar once the code has been downloaded. After major releases, you may need to run configure again.  ./openbazaar help This gives you a list of arguments you can use when launching OpenBazaar.  ./openbazaar start This launches OpenBazaar.  ./openbazaar stop This shuts down OpenBazaar.  git pull If git is correctly installed, this will update the software if there are new changes.Tips and Tricks  Try refreshing the page occasionally if things aren’t working correctly.  Wait a minute or two when first connecting to find peers. It shouldn’t take any longer than this.  If you have connectivity problems, try using killall python -9 in terminal, then launch OpenBazaar again.  If you receive a “Address already in use” error when starting OpenBazaar, this means the program was already running. Stop it first, then launch again.  If your client crashes or has an obvious error, try looking for /logs/production.log and searching for ‘Traceback’ to see what the error was. If you don’t see anyone else posting about that error on the Github issues and our Help Desk then feel free to post along with the error and some context.",

                "title": "OpenBazaar Threat Model", 
                "content": "This blog post outlines the security model and policies of OpenBazaar. It is written for contributors with push access who are asked to review and merge pull requests, external developers who are interested in submitting pull requests, and end-users who are interested in understanding the security model of OpenBazaar. We will also be including this threat model in our project documentation, but we are sharing on our blog first to solicit feedback from our users and security experts in the field. Every contributor with push access must read this document.Threat modelOpenBazaar makes important assumptions about the strength of its adversaries. To understand how to properly develop code for OpenBazaar, it is crucial to understand who the adversaries of OpenBazaar can be, what resources they are able to employ, and what their goals are. Furthermore, it is important to understand what the adversaries are not capable of.Assumed adversariesOur adversaries can be broadly categorized as 4 different entities:  Malicious users  Malicious corporations  Malicious governments  Malicious developersEach of these constitutes a separate entity with different resources and different goals. These are explained below.Malicious usersA malicious user is a user who tries to break the security of OpenBazaar, usually for financial gain. We treat malicious users as game-theoretic agents who are able to invest approximately as much as they would win out of a security breach, as long as their winnings are significantly larger than their losses. The goal of malicious users is to make money. The two primary ways of making money by breaking the security of OpenBazaar are these:  Being able to receive a product without making a proper payment  Being able to receive money without delivering a productAs these attacks are financially incentivized, there is no limit as to what capital can be invested in such attacks if it’s possible to earn it back. However, for our purposes, we assume that such attackers are limited to up-front investments of $1,000,000 per year collectively. Thus, they are not able to, for example, break the bitcoin network security, or attack 1024-bit RSA keys. These attackers are the easiest to model, as they play within the closed OpenBazaar system and can be treated game-theoretically. Generally, in our games, these agents can be assumed to be ε-good, meaning they will not attempt a malicious strategy if there is no financial gain in it. We aim to fully protect users from such malicious actors.Malicious corporationsCertain corporations may find the OpenBazaar network undesirable and may want to break its security in order to bring it down. Their financial incentive may not be part of the closed OpenBazaar system: They may be able to make profits outside of OpenBazaar by making OpenBazaar unreliable and insecure. The goals of such agents are the following:  Bringing down the majority of OpenBazaar nodes  Disrupting the majority of connectivity of the OpenBazaar network  Breaking the trust people have on the OpenBazaar network“Breaking the trust” here means creating arbitrary buyers and sellers that do not follow the expected strategy and default on their payments or shipping. The incentive for such corporations may be that they are losing money because of competitive sales on the OpenBazaar network. We currently assume that such corporations are able to spend similar monetary amounts as malicious users to attack the network. However, malicious corporations cannot be modeled as ε-good, as they wish to cause harm on the network through external incentives. We aim to partially protect our users from such malicious actors, through reputation systems and positive margins in our nash equilibria that can decentivize such malicious actors. Reputation systems which require proof-of-burn or similar sybil-resistant schemes help in making these attacks more costly. Webs-of-trust can fully protect careful users from such malicious actors, although great care is required from the user side.Malicious governmentsAs the OpenBazaar software can be operated worldwide, malicious governments should be taken into account. Malicious governments may wish to bring the network down for censorship reasons or for legal reasons. The goals of such agents are similar to the goals of malicious corporations. In addition, a malicious government has the following goals:  Unmask the anonymity of an OpenBazaar user  Block certain categories of products or individual products from being tradedA malicious government has similar resources as a malicious corporation. Malicious governments can be categorized into active and passive based on their willingness to interfere with networks. A passive government is unwilling to manipulate data as a man-in-the-middle at the network level, and is only willing to be a passive eavesdropper. An active government is happy to interfere with network traffic by manipulating it. A passive government has access to these additional resources:  They can manipulate the legal framework of their country  They can introduce new laws  They can issue arbitrary subpoenas and warrants  They can issue secret warrants and take decisions in secret courtsAn active government has, in addition, access to the following resources:  They can sybil-attack the issue of identification documents such as passports  They can man-in-the-middle Internet connections within their country (up to the Tor security assumptions)  They can break Internet connectivity within their country  They can issue arbitrary PKI certificates for HTTPS and TLS protocolsMalicious governments are the hardest attack to guard against. While our goal is to be able to defend against malicious governments, we are not able to do this currently. Our decentralization efforts are oriented around the idea that basic protection from malicious governments should be possible. We aim to provide full protection against a passive malicious government, and partial protection against active malicious governments. On the topic of denial-of-service attacks by breaking network connectivity completely, we do not have a mechanism of defence. We rely on the fact that countries will prefer to keep Internet connectivity for the most part of their users. Mesh networks can be used to guard against such attacks, but these are beyond the scope of our threat model.Malicious developersThe last malicious actor is a malicious developer with commit access. These developers are manipulated by one of the above actors through law (secret subpoenas) or bribery in order to achieve their end-goals. Therefore, the goals of a malicious developer are aligned with the goals of those above. We prefer to list this malicious actor separately, as they have access to a different arsenal of attacks. In particular, a malicious developer has access to the following resources:  They can merge arbitrary pull requests, in effect writing arbitrary codeOur primary means of defence against malicious developers are secure development practices, some of which we explain later in this document.Security assumptionsWe rely on the assumption that certain systems are secure. We make the assumption that the following constituent parts of our system are secure:  RSA, ECDSA, SHA256, AES and the rest of the cryptographic primitives used by the software  GPG  Bitcoin  Namecoin  Tor (including its assumptions on network monitoring)  The browser used by the user  The user’s computer  Our implementation languages and frameworks (Python, Javascript, Angular)  The libraries we rely on which are listed here: https://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar/blob/master/requirements.txtBeta statusOpenBazaar is currently in beta and is facing multiple security issues, in addition to the assumptions above. These issues can cause your transactions to be compromised, your money not to go through or be stolen, or your products not to be delivered, even by attackers with very limited resources. We estimate that an attacker could possibly compromise the system’s security for less than a few thousand dollars. Please be careful when using OpenBazaar at this stage. If you’re using the regular bitcoin network, keep the amounts exchanged low (less than a few hundred dollars). Don’t sell your car on OpenBazaar yet! For the beta version, we rely on the security of HTTPS and PKI. This is needed, as we rely on pip for securely fetching python packages, which relies on HTTPS. Therefore, an active malicious government is able to interfere with OpenBazaar. The specific assumptions are listed below. However, we are interested in dropping this requirement for stable versions. We are still unsure of the distribution channels to achieve this. As part of our beta status, we also rely on a few centralized pieces of infrastructure, all of which we would like to replace with decentralized systems. These are our assumptions for the beta version:  PKI is secure. CAs are not compromised or government-controlled.  HTTPS is secure.  The operators of seed servers are not interested in performing denial-of-service attacks.  Obelisk and the official obelisk servers are secure and their owners not malicious.  The official DNSChain servers are secure and their owners not malicious.The last two requirements are strong. A user who is concerned with these last points can lift these requirements by running their own Obelisk server or using a trusted Obelisk server, which requires maintaining a bitcoin blockchain copy, and their own DNSChain server, which requires maintaining a namecoin blockchain copy. We have plans to use SVP systems as a replacement for these. We may introduce additional points of centralization for future beta versions in order to create a working product, which we plan to lift later. As part of our Beta status, we do not currently employ any anonymity-preserving mechanisms. All transactions are completely trackable. Therefore, malicious governments with the goal of uncovering your identity will succeed trivially.Development infrastructureWe also rely on certain pieces of centralized infrastructure for development. Here are our assumptions about services we use for development and we assume are secure and with no malicious operators:  GitHub  Slack  GmailWe also rely on OTR and GPG for secure development-related communications.Development processIn order to guard against actors such as malicious developers, we are publishing all of the source code of OpenBazaar as open source under the MIT license. We encourage security experts to audit our code for security vulnerabilities. Don’t take our word on the security of OpenBazaar; inspect the code yourself. Don’t trust the OpenBazaar developers. While we’re doing our best to provide secure software, the reason it’s open source is so that it can be reviewed and audited. Our development process is transparent and security-oriented. We follow certain contributing guidelines which require code reviews and follow proper release cycles. The details of our contributing procedures can be found in the CONTRIBUTING document. We don’t just make our code open source. Our reviews and commit history are also available for inspection, so that differential audits are possible. We GPG-sign our releases with contributor keys in the strong GPG set. Currently, Dionysis Zindros signs releases. The signature signifies that the release maintainer believes the source code to be secure at the time of release, and that it was intentionally released by the team, without backdoors or intentional vulnerabilities as far as we know. These signatures are hard to fake by someone who wishes to introduce backdoors in the future. If you require strong security, do not run releases that have not been GPG-signed, or manually inspect the code. Otherwise, at least make sure your binaries and sources are at least downloaded via HTTPS. Our decision-making procedure is transparent too. We use 2-of-4 multisig decision-making for financial decisions. The details of our transparency in decision making can be found in our transparency post. Some of our commits are GPG-signed. The GPG-signed commits signify that:  The code introduced in the commit is believed to be secure by the signer  The parent of the commit is the currently available branch to the signerPlease note that signing a commit, contrary to popular belief, does not indicate that all the previous commits have been checked by the committer. It only indicates that the particular commit code really is written by the person who signed the commit, and this is it. It is very easy to introduce fake commits on git and GitHub, using usernames and e-mails of existing contributors. Therefore, we prefer signing individual commits instead of tagging and signing only occasionally to show a full good history. It’s impractical to create a tag for every commit one creates.",

                "title": "Evolution Exit Scam Shows Multisig Isn't Enough: We need Decentralization", 
                "content": "This week another darknet market closed abruptly. The Evolution site operators stole millions of dollars worth of users’ bitcoins. This is only the latest in a series of “exit scams” where the operators of these centralized markets will run legitimately for months, even years, and then run off with all the funds at once. When previous exit scams occurred, the proposed solution was implementing multisignature into the marketplaces. Users were told to only use marketplaces that offered multisig. This does make the users’ funds more secure – in theory. In practice, even though multisig was available in Evolution, it wasn’t widely used. People still trusted the centralized site operators with their Bitcoin.  Why would people still misplace their trust when this pattern has become obvious? One reason is that they are dealing with illegal items. Not all items on darknet markets are illegal, but a substantial portion are. They have no legal recourse if something goes wrong. This means they look for the most trusted site in operation, the one with the largest network of other users. As the number of users increases, so does the notoriety, publicity, and demands on the site infrastructure. With the increased stress and scrutiny on the system, the site operators have little margin for error. If something does go wrong, or the pressure becomes too intense, then those site operators will exit while they still can, taking down the entire system. Even in legal marketplaces, centralized systems share this flaw. The single point of control gives site operators the ability to determine the fate of the platform, and all its users. How can this be prevented? We’ve already mentioned multisig. Evolution implemented it, but did so in a way that was intended to still retain power over users’ funds. They required users to deposit funds with them, and then move them into the multisig later. A centralized site operator doesn’t want to give up their ability to extract fees from its users, so they don’t have a strong incentive to make multisig easy to use. Also, multisig might protect funds, but it doesn’t prevent the platform from shutting down altogether. The solution is to move away from the centralized systems completely. Removing the middleman will have enormous benefits for users. Consider the following benefits of decentralized markets:  Markets are persistent. There’s no central point of control that can be taken down, either by outside actors or internal ones.  Funds aren’t centrally controlled. There’s no central authority to trust and no jackpot to steal. Individuals control their funds directly and likely use multisig for transactions.  No fees. Trade occurs directly between parties; there’s no site operator to take a cut.  No data aggregation. Site operators (and data thieves) profit from aggregation of data on centralized systems, but there’s no single trove of data on decentralized system.  Trust and reputation are dynamic. In a centralized system, you are forced to trust the site operators, and the reputation system is static (as determined by site operators). In a decentralized system, you aren’t forced to trust any parties, and reputation systems can emerge without any control or censorship by central authorities.Unfortunately for everyone on the internet, decentralized markets are still in their infancy. Over the last eight months OpenBazaar has teased the community with a taste of what the future of trade looks like. We are pushing hard, and are closer than ever to making it a reality. We know you wanted it yesterday, but our mission is not just to push out a product. Our goal is to create an open protocol for trade that will give users to power to push aside the central institutions that control online trade, and begin trading freely. It’s not a simple task, but with your help we’re getting close.",

                "content": "We recently faced a minor security incident at the OpenBazaar GitHub repository. An attacker was able to briefly gain push access and make code changes that remained undetected for about one hour, by pretending to be a developer with contributor access who lost access to his normal account. The changes that the attacker made to the code were insignificant and were not related to security – they were mostly tests. Only the “develop” branch was affected, not the “master” branch. As our users run the “master” branch, we expect no users to be affected by this breach. We reverted the code changes immediately and access rights were restored. We don’t expect anyone to be affected by this attack. As a response to the attack, we are on the process of developing more rigorous security policies which would require proper authentication for committer username changes. Our new policies will also include operational security requirements for existing developers. In response to the attack and in coordination with GitHub, we have ensured that the accounts of the attacker have been appropriately banned. As part of our transparency commitment to our users, we are publishing this security incident so that people are aware of our potential problems and solutions.

                "title": "On Leading Open Source Projects", 
                "content": "OpenBazaar is now almost eight months old. We’ve grown from myself to over 58 contributors over the life of the project, with a community response that has been overwhelming at times. One of the largest challenges of a project like this is building and maintaining a great team. Take an open source project, intentionally make it unfunded with no profit model, and now you have a much more difficult challenge. For the last eight months we have had little to no worries in this department as our core team has slowly grown. Unfortunately, that could not last forever. Since our team is contributing in their spare hours and have families, jobs, and other obligations, several particpants have had to reduce their contributions to the project. We recently announced an approach to move to a team-based development structure where individuals would be responsible for different aspects of the project. This was in response to the team growing quickly and myself and the core devs feeling like this would be a better way to manage everything going on. I wondered if this might be a little premature to do so, but it felt right considering the team we had put together. Now we have recently lost a few team members due to several factors and who will now be serving in a diminished capacity as they tend to their other responsibilities. This change means we need to refocus our efforts and be realistic about how the project will progress. To be clear, while the number of contributors has decreased, we still have a good team and we’re confident that we can deliver a full release in a reasonable amount of time. I’m making this post because we decided early on that the OpenBazaar project would be as transparent and honest with the community as possible, so when we have new developments we put that information out as soon as possible. I am currently working with the core devs to distill down our future plans into critical areas that need to get done. We will be simplifying and stepping back to ensure we tackle only the most necessary pieces of our software. The first priority is the p2p network. Our second priority is the trading protocol. Finally we will continue to improve the user interface and push towards the vision of a standalone app that works across all platforms. [caption id=”” align=”alignright” width=”340”] This train keeps rolling.[/caption] As we rolled out our current solution we have run into several issues around our infrastructure that’s in place. One critical decision we made was that in order to support Tor we stuck with TCP-based connections between peers using ZeroMQ. We have tried many different approaches, but it seems like using ZeroMQ in this p2p capacity may be a tough road ahead. We are currently investigating several other approaches including moving to UDP-based networking and leveraging proven libraries like libtorrent who have solved many of the connectivity problems we are experiencing, while still allowing use of Tor. This should be exciting and we hope this work will bear fruit soon. If you have any p2p networking experience and would like to help us tackle this problem please reach out. We’d love to have your help. Our next big focus area will be on the trading protocol, which we will be calling the OpenBazaar Marketplace Protocol (OBMP). There are many details of how this will work and what will be included, but we believe that by clearly defining the protocol and what is expected between nodes to communicate and peers to trade we will improve the stability and security of the network as a whole. More details to be released soon on this.  Finally we will continue to improve the user interface and push towards the vision of a standalone app that works across all platforms.We showed off earlier this year a new interface we intended to have ready for the fourth beta release. We are still working towards it, but our lead designer is one of the members who has had to step back from the project for a while. We are regrouping and putting together a group of designers that will pick up the torch where it was left off and help us reach the original vision, but it will be delayed from the original timeline. Design by committee is not always the best solution, but placing eggs all in one basket and losing the basket can also be pretty devastating to progress and we will all have to be patient as we move forward. As always we plan to be completely transparent and while it is disappointing to experience set backs like these we are happy to see our project alumni go on to work diligently at prominent companies, or continue their education. One of the best things about a project like this is to experience many different contributor viewpoints and to learn as we go on. This is something I am personally getting used to and hopefully you all continue to support our vision and are excited to see us keep moving towards a fully working OpenBazaar!",

                "title": "Bitcoin, Free Trade, and Terrible Humans", 
                "content": "There is something terrifying yet beautiful about the concept of a truly digital culture. As a father of two young boys I take a stab at guessing what life will be like in 20 years and it actually seems kind of scary. In the last several years we’ve seen selfies, multi-billion dollar companies run by early 20-somethings and despicable crimes and corruption by people we supposedly trusted in positions of authority throughout the political and financial community.Out of all of this mess rose a dark horse underdog called Bitcoin. Created by an anonymous individual or individuals backed by a passionate community of developers, this promise of financial and electronic freedom has motivated a movement of hackers, nay people, who refuse to settle for the status quo and push the boundaries of what is possible with computing technology. They decided to stop building photo sharing apps or novel ways to sell mobile game in-app purchases with the promise of making it filthy rich. For those that want to change the world Bitcoin is supposedly the panacea.Miguel Ruiz once said “People like to say that the conflict is between good and evil. The real conflict is between truth and lies.” In the world of Bitcoin we often fall into an oversimplified argument of what is good and what is evil on either side. Bitcoiners will describe bankers as “banksters” and point out their exploitation of consumers through sub-prime loans or just bad business practice. Banking elites will finger the opposite as drug dealers, child pornographers or havoc reekers focused on destroying the sanity of the financial industry. Who is right? Who will win in the end?I purposely leave that question for you to answer. I lead a project called OpenBazaar. Our goal is to revolutionize commerce and trade across the globe leveraging freedom supporting and privacy enabling technologies like Bittorrent, Tor and Bitcoin. My family, both my immediate and in-laws, understand what it means to run local businesses. My in-laws run a local deli and food truck while my mother and sister run an Etsy and eBay store selling girl’s hair bows.  These are modest businesses, but they know just as well as anyone the ins and outs of running a business and interacting with strangers. Other members of our team are familiar with the struggles of other types of individuals, whether it’s family in Guatemala that could benefit from freedom of trade or suppressed women in oppressive countries hoping to bring a little extra income to their families. Regardless of where in the world you hail from there are true benefits from opening up global trade and loosening the restrictions on interacting with your fellow world citizens.When I hear people criticize our mission or compare our efforts as “yet another attempt at providing protection to drug dealers, human traffickers or child pornographers” it hurts. For those of us who contribute our spare time and pour our souls into this project we don’t relate to this mischaracterization. Many of us have kids and families. Some of us are doctors, work at prestigious companies, are students. We come from all areas of the world. Why does this happen? How does that work? How do that many individuals across the world come together to dedicate so much time and emotion into something that purely elicits illegal behavior? It’s simply not true. We are here because we believe that people deserve to be free. We deserve to take our God-given talents and share them with the world and in return be rewarded for that hard work. We deserve the right to sell our homemade goods, to sell our eBooks, to loan money to less fortunate or to start crowd funding campaigns aimed at helping the homeless. Some call us naive to think that what we’re building won’t become the “next Silk Road” or the “hydra whose head cannot be cut off by law enforcement”. While a network protocol such as the one we’re developing could facilitate these types of activities we invite you to open your mind and think bigger. Besides there are plenty of other technologies, which make illegal activities easier: telephones, cash, the Internet as a whole, forum boards. Even today Andy Greenberg wrote an interesting piece about the RAMP marketplace in Russia that has been operating longer than Silk Road and is more effectively evading law enforcement.Those individuals who need this type of online capability will seek it and build it with or without OpenBazaar and what we are doing is not aiming to provide those folks with such a niche solution. OpenBazaar can be so much more. To limit it’s potential to that single use case is to waste the brain power of all involved. It would be akin to me inventing the writing instrument and for the rest of time only using it to draw bad sketches of Nicholas Cage. We feel it’s worth the effort to fight this stigma in order to realize our goal of freedom in trade for all not some.Another aspect of our project is that we are self-sustaining. We are not taking this idea and wrapping it in fees and ads or monetizing your identity data to buy a Ferrari (no offense to Ferrari I love those things). This is not a pump and dump. This is not a hustle. We are transparent and open. If you feel we aren’t being transparent enough we’ll fix it and be glad to answer all your questions (please note Washington does have an early bed time). Technology can be enabling and empowering, but when others take advantage of that allure of a “free lunch” it often becomes problematic. Too many times you see a mom and pop type startup win over the public with their down to earth approach, free product and small man viewpoint and then all of a sudden some venture capitalists come in with their funding, the original founders cash out and we are left with a shell of the original idea plus exorbitant fees and restrictions. Before you realize it, you are the product. We choose to respect the user. You are not a product.    You are not your job. You’re not how much money you have in the bank. You are not the car you drive. You’re not the contents of your wallet. You are not your fucking khakis. - Fight ClubOur project team is striving towards a completely open protocol and technology stack that focuses on security, privacy and usability. We have not conducted an elaborate fundraising scheme or garnered multi-million dollar investment rounds or issues crypto assets. This is because the most valuable asset to a project of our position is people and you can’t ask for donations of people. The reason why we exist is because smart, interesting and brilliant people have decided to help us bring Amir Taaki’s original vision to fruition. It may not be quite as anarchistic or devious as he planned originally, but it is freedom. It is another step towards a global community. A place we can all agree is better for our children and our grandchildren so that someday they won’t have to worry about exorbitant college educations, unfair taxes or oppressive rules that limit their ability to be who they truly want to be. This is why we stay up until 4am each night hacking away at lines of code that most people will never see.This is OpenBazaar.",

Since the project began in April, the number of people contributing to the OpenBazaar project has steadily grown. We now have enough people to create small teams dedicated to specific areas. These teams will allow the project to focus on areas that are important, and not duplicate efforts. This team creation has already been occurring spontaneously, but we’ve decided to make it more formal as we keep developing the platform. It’s likely that these teams, their mission, and their members will change over time as we figure out what works and what doesn’t. As the project lead, Brian Hoffman will work with these teams to make sure they are heading in the right direction. Each team has their own mission, and the core mission of OpenBazaar is “To enable global free trade online.” We’ve identified 11 areas we want to have teams focusing on;  Code Quality  Design &amp; UX  Legal  Marketing  Networking  OB Developer Network  OB Labs  Operations &amp; Recruiting  Quality Assurance  Security  WindowsCode QualityThe code quality team will facilitate long-term open source development, and make contributions a learning experience.

                "content": "Today we are announcing the OpenBazaar Developer Network or ‘OBDN’. We recently asked for volunteers to help with the front-end development of the OpenBazaar client, and we’re pleasantly surprised to receive more than 20 responses from volunteers in only the first week. We realized that there are many people who want to contribute to the online free trade movement, but they aren’t sure how to get involved. In order to bring in more developers to help make OpenBazaar a reality, we decided to begin creating the OpenBazaar Developer Network (OBDN). It will be a platform that allows a community of OpenBazaar developers to share their ideas, collaborate on how best to implement these ideas, and then make them a reality. OBDN will allow the community to propose new features and vote on which features they want to see implemented. The OpenBazaar team leads found here will use the OBDN to find help for specific tasks within their areas. APIs and other tools will be available for developers who wish to build plugins or new services on top of the OpenBazaar network. To ensure that we are working with developers who genuinely want to contribute, we plan on OBDN being invitation only. There will be an application process for access to the network once we have a functional beta, which we hope to roll out in mid-January. If you’re interested in helping build this platform with us, please contact Braden Glasgow. Email: braden@openbazaar.org  Twitter: @bradenglasgow",

                "title": "Migration of our project funds to a multisig address.", 
                "content": "We, the undersigned core developers of OpenBazaar, have decided with consensus on the following on November 4th, 2014: Because of the facts that: (1) Developers can be malicious Our threat model involves powerful agents at play. These can include malicious governments who have the ability to issue secret warrants legally requiring developers to take certain actions. We therefore follow a trust-but-verify model in all our development process. As such, certain developers of the project may in the future be legally required to perform actions that they do not agree with, without the ability to communicate this fact to others. Through multisig, we are requiring at least one more developer to perform a check on financial decisions as a safety-net. (2) Mistakes happen We are human and often make mistakes. This can include lost wallet keys, or destroyed laptops. Multisig will allow us to migrate our funds in case one developer loses their keys. We also sometimes make transactions that may be incorrect. A second pair of eyes is good to make sure we don’t burn our funds or we don’t send them to the wrong third party. (3) Developers can become unavailable Developers may become unavailable for various reasons such as accident or death. We do not want to depend on one individual for all our funds. In case of unavailability, multisig allows us to move our funds to a new address. (4) Dictatorship is evil We take team decisions with consensus. However, sometimes consensus cannot be reached. We have never had this problem in our team yet, but it is bound to happen in the future. In cases where consensus cannot be reached, an individual developer should not have the power to act solely as a dictator and enforce their opinion. Multisig requires at least one more party to consent. This acts as a safety net. (5) Transparency is good We believe in a transparent development model. All our code is open source. We interact with the community through public chat on IRC, on a public subreddit, and in forums, all viewable by anyone. We plan features and submit bug reports through GitHub issues, which are public. Anyone is able to criticize us through these channels directly, even pseudonymously. As of Beta 3, we are also making all all-hands developer video calls publicly available through live streaming, and they are recorded for future reference. We wish to be held accountable for our actions, and we invite the criticism of the community. In this direction, as we are funded through donations, we believe the public should know exactly how much money we have and where and when exactly it is spent. By publishing our multisig address, we submit our financial records to public scrutiny. Now, therefore, we are announcing the following: (1) Ownership of public keys Each of us controls one of the following public bitcoin keys. We are providing bitcoin signatures as proof that we are in control of each.

                "content": "Note: This blog post is outdated. Read this article for the latest code. OpenBazaar was started in early April of this year as a proof of concept. The first few months were a small experiment to see how it could work. A month ago, we released the first beta, and it’s grown to a platform that people are beginning to test and use. You can check out what the network looks like in the video below. Today, beta 2.0 goes live. For a project of this magnitude to succeed it takes more than just a little elbow grease on the weekends. To build a world-class, production ready piece of software that passes security audits and can claim features like censorship-resistance, resilience, and pseudo-anonymity we must have considerable contributions in terms of people, finances and interest. We’ve been pleasantly surprised at the interest we’ve received, and we’re finally starting to nail down the people aspect as well. We’ve had several great additions to the team and the impact it has made is jarring. Our codebase is currently going through a cleansing process and being poked and prodded from all angles to ensure we are delivering quality source code. Our development methodology is getting a thorough adjustment to simplify the contribution model, but at the same time provide additional structure and organization to the project. This has been a frustrating but fruitful process as we shift from a one man coding show to a team of professional individuals working together. This shift may slow down the roll-out of new features, but long-term it makes the code much more secure, easier to understand and contribute to, and will prevent growing pains down the road. As such, we are shifting away from rolling out a full release at the end of the year, and moving instead to release new betas each month until we feel the code is worthy of being called a full release. Because this is a security product, we are slowing down the additions of new features until we have implemented full unit testing and a significant refactoring of the code. Once these have been achieved we will then build new features on the proper foundation. One other really exciting aspect of the project in my eyes is the future of our user interface. Anyone with development experience can see that our current UI is mostly based off of the Bootstrap style. While great for bootstrapping an application, it doesn’t have its own personality and soon will we start to shed that exterior. We have a very talented set of designers and can’t wait to reveal more about what this will look like. The product will be much more intuitive, which is one of our primary goals as we roll this product out to the larger community. To sum it all up we are making great progress and you the community are truly stepping up to support us whether through Reddit posts, bug reports, code contributions, donations or any of the other myriad ways to help us out. We feel the love and we are doing our best to return it to you. We do this for the betterment of our fellow global citizens, not to become millionaires. We call on you to help us make OpenBazaar the most exciting project on Internet!",

                "content": "Note: This blog post is outdated. Read this article for the latest code. If you want to test out OpenBazaar, but don’t want to install it (or can’t) on your own computer, you can rent a Virtual Private Server (VPS) instead. If you already have a VPS, you can run the OpenBazaar installation and then skip to this section. There are many different VPS services available, and they typically provide the same services. One of the more popular is Digital Ocean. You can sign up and start running a VPS with their service easily, or shop around and choose another service. You can choose how large you want the space to be. OpenBazaar and it’s dependencies are around 5 GB, so we recommend 7 GBs or more. You don’t need large amounts of RAM or anything fancy. These types of installs are typically inexpensive, $5 or $10 a month. You can then choose your OS. I recommend Ubuntu, either 12 or 14 should be fine. Once you’ve rented a VPS, chosen and installed your OS, you should receive instructions on how to ssh into your machine, or some VPS allow you to access the terminal via web interface. Either way, you can now install OpenBazaar by following these instructions. One tip: it can sometimes take a long time to generate a key pair. If you run this command first, it will speed up that process considerably: sudo apt-get install havegedConfiguring Your SSH ClientFor your desktop or laptop, I recommend using PuTTY. vSSH is the clear winner for iPhone or Android; please purchase the full featured app to support the devs for making an excellent application. The configuration is somewhat similar for PuTTY and vSSH. Firstly, add in the host IP address of your VPS (remember to save your configuration once your done to save time):  Depending on how you configured your VPS above, you may have a password or private key for authenticating your session. If you have a ppk (like me), select the file’s location on laptop or mobile device (this may be more difficult with iOS as it lacks any sort of accessible file system, so you may be better off going with a password):  Setup your port forwarding so that port 8888 from your VPS is forwarded to your localhost port 8888.  Your source port is ‘8888’ and source IP is 127.0.0.1  Your destination port is ‘8888’ and destination IP is 127.0.0.1  Type = Local In PuTTY, the end result should look like this: Running Your NodeAssuming you have configured your VPS and SSH client correctly, all you have to do is start a session with your VPS and navigate to your OpenBazaar folder to run the node as instructed. The best way to do that is to run your node with UPnP disabled and forcing the node to use port 8888 (doesn’t have to be port 8888, you can select any port number you want… just make sure your SSH client is forwarding the right port to your local host). This can be achieved through the following command: ./openbazaar -q 8888 --disable-open-browser start Recommended: Your node will go down the moment you disconnect your SSH session. To keep running your OpenBazaar node after your session has ended, enter the following command to run your node (instead of above): $ nohup ./openbazaar -q 8888 --disable-open-browser start &amp; Open up your browser and enter the following address to access your OB node: 127.0.0.1:8888 This works surprisingly well on mobile devices using vSSH and is a testament to how powerful OpenBazaar can become in the future!",

            "blog-why-proof-of-burn": { 
                "title": "Why proof-of-burn?", 
                "content": "We’ve had many people commenting on our proof-of-burn scheme as the basis for our reputation pledge system which forms one of the core pillars of our identity and trust platform for OpenBazaar. As previously explained on our blog, with proof-of-burn, you’ve invested resources that create an incentive to keep a good reputation and impose a significant cost for abandoning that reputation. This reputation is associated with your pseudonymous identity. Some of the technical details behind these ideas are detailed on my paper, but read on if you want to see why we chose proof-of-burn instead of other alternatives. People have expressed concerns about how the reputation pledging scheme alone is able to prevent us from fraud. I wanted to point out that we’re still in beta 1 and that we’re working hard to address all of these concerns: This reputation pledge system will not be used on its own. Our trust and identity system is far from complete, and we aim to combine several powerful tactics to achieve a system in which each node’s reputation is reliable. We’re researching ways to do this and we’re working on several drafts, including a web-of-trust, surety bonds, trust-as-risk, and other alternatives, which can be combined together to form a more powerful scheme and ensure safety on the network. We will publish more information and details on these schemes as they solidify. We understand that trust is a core component of a decentralized market, and we are making it our priority to build a truly free marketplace where people can be trusted even though pseudonymous. There are two popular schemes that people are suggesting to us to use instead of proof-of-burn: These are proof-to-miner and proof-of-donation. We’ve heard about these suggestions on reddit and elsewhere. While we do like charities and wish we could donate burned money to them, this is simply not feasible, and the reasons are security-related and technical. The same applies to donating to miners, or others schemes in which funds are allocated at random. In fact, some people suggested that nodes acquire reputation by donating to the OpenBazaar development team itself, but again this has the same issues that I’m explaining below (although you can always donate directly :D). The reason why a donation to a charity or a list of charities does not work (at least naively) is because it introduces a single-point-of-failure to the system. It is important to note here that our threat model is widely more paranoid than that employed by traditional e-shops. We aim to protect buyer and seller privacy and make the market impossible to censor by governments, big corporations, or other powerful agents. In this endeavor, one possible enemy is a malicious government which, through its legal system, issues a, perhaps secret, warrant which aims to shut down or otherwise disrupt the market. This is something we want to guard against, as we’ve seen it used again and again against various pieces of software that contained centralized components. We simply do not wish to rely on law to ensure the privacy and trustworthiness of our system. The way to guard against such attacks is through true decentralization. When a charity or the OpenBazaar development team is receiving the funds of reputation pledges, this means that the people holding the private keys to the funds have the ability to centrally control the OpenBazaar network and break its security. Assume we decided to use reputation pledges to fund OpenBazaar development (a similar argument exists for charities). In this case, a malicious government who wishes to circumvent our security, must follow these steps:  First, create an OpenBazaar market.  Then, issue a secret warrant against the OpenBazaar developers asking them to forfeit their private keys. In multisig cases, ask for all the private keys.  Subsequently, donate some amount X to the OpenBazaar development team in a “reputation pledging” move.  Use the private keys obtained in step 2 to access the funds “pledged” and move it back to your own address. No money has been spent to do this.  Repeat ad infinitum.By following these steps, the malicious party can arbitrarily increase the reputation of any node they choose. One easy way to disrupt the market is then to randomly choose nodes on the network and increase their reputation arbitrarily, rendering our reputation system completely useless. In fact, the malicious agent in this case can increase reputation as much as they want instantaneously. In case a proof-to-miner scheme is used, a malicious party can act to disrupt the market even without the legal power of warrants. The malicious party in this case can be any miner, even with little mining power. In this scheme, the malicious miner follows these steps:  First, create an OpenBazaar market.  Then, create a proof-to-miner transaction with some amount X which is a “reputation pledge” for your identity towards miners, but keep it secret.  Start mining the next block, and include your secret transaction in your attempt.  If you mine successfully, you’ve acquired reputation. No money has been spent to do this, as they are “donated” back to you. In this case, publish your secret transaction to the network.  If you fail to mine this block, double-spend the amount from the secret transaction in a new reputation pledge attempt. The network won’t see the double-spending, as the first transaction remains secret.  Repeat ad infinitum.Again, a miner would be able to create an arbitrary amount of reputation for any node they choose and disrupt the network. However, in this case, the rate at which a miner can generate reputation is proportional to the money they own multiplied by their mining power. As you can see, these naïve attempts to avoid proof-of-burn are unsuccessful. However, there have been several alternative suggestions, and we welcome your opinion in designing our schemes. While more complicated ideas are welcome and we are happy to discuss them, one of our priorities is to have a usable yet secure product by the end of the year, and some of these schemes are simply not feasible to implement in such a short timeframe; let’s keep in mind that shorter code means code that is easier to review and audit for security issues, and we want trust-related code to be thoroughly audited for security. It seems that many people feel uncomfortable burning coins, and I wish to address their concerns in this post. As Vitalik Butern of Ethereum points out:  The destruction of BTC does not translate into a destruction of economic value; the value simply gets redistributed proportionately among everyone else. Hence, the protocols are actually efficient (i.e. not wasteful).Or, to quote Satoshi Nakamoto:  Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.The best and simplest explanation as to why value is not lost comes from /u/Amanojack:  There seems to be a widespread perception that destroying coins is somehow related to destroying wealth. It’s just a name; nothing is actually being destroyed in terms of real world wealth or purchasing power, but just being moved around. Proof of burn is actually proof of donation (to every other bitcoin holder, in proportion to how many bitcoins each person holds). Money is just a form of memory: it records, either in a low-tech way (gold/paper) or high-tech way (Bitcoin), who did what for whom in society. It’s a kind of favor-voucher that you give to people who did something for you and you receive when you do something for someone else. Destroying your favor-vouchers of course doesn’t hurt anyone else; in fact it makes everyone else’s worth more. There are now fewer vouchers chasing the same amount of available favors (goods and services) in society, since one person - the voucher burner - was nice enough to throw away his right to collect goods and services from others.With these schemes, it will be the first time it becomes possible to trust truly pseudonymous individuals without the need of trusting any authority or centralized system. While we’re very excited to address these issues, they are hard problems that require experimentation, thorough security reviews and auditing, as well as theoretical work as their foundation, so all of this requires time to mature. We ask for your patience as we build this system and further explore its possibilities. We’re looking forward to building a market where sellers and buyers can trade safely, in which trust can be established between transacting parties by the network without sacrificing any anonymity. We want people to feel secure in their transactions, so that they can finally trade online with privacy and freedom.",

                "content": "We are happy to announce that we decided to release OpenBazaar under the MIT license. OpenBazaar had previously been released under AGPL. After lengthy discussions on the matter, the team arrived at the consensus to move forward with relicensing under MIT. We believe the MIT license will help us better achieve our vision of building a platform of free trade, where anyone can exchange goods and services via the Internet in an uncensored and privacy-respecting manner. We feel it is crucial to publish our code under a very permissive open source license in order to let people freely build software upon our platform as they see fit. While we’re building the canonical OpenBazaar node software, we believe the power and accessibility of the OpenBazaar network will thrive through the use of a multitude of clients who have access to our secure, pseudonymous, and decentralized system of trade. We expect others to build both commercial and free clients that can access our network, leverage the versatility of the Ricardian contract system, utilize powerful blockchain-based transactions to ensure safety, and support their own systems with our trust and identity service. By releasing under MIT, we are allowing these things to happen, and we hope this will, in turn, empower the OpenBazaar network to widen. This is our way of saying we invite you to participate in our platform, whoever you may be. We hope this will encourage developers to start building code which makes use of these virtues and feel free to base it on our own code, so that, together, we can create a world where people can trade with freedom and safety.",

                "content": "Note: This blog post is outdated. Read this article for the latest code.Should I participate in the beta?Thanks for wanting to be involved with the OpenBazaar beta. We need the community to tell us what works and what doesn’t, so we appreciate your help. However, participation in the beta is not for everyone, and not without risks. The platform is far from being complete, and those looking for a fully functional ecommerce platform are better off waiting until the full release, or at least later beta versions. We will be releasing new beta versions each month. The beta is for testing, and while you can engage in real trade, the purpose will be to test the platform, not actually run a store. Consider these points when deciding whether or not to enter the beta:  Beta participation will require some level of technical expertise. Installation details below. You will need to install quite a few dependencies.  Users are not anonymous on the OpenBazaar network. Your IP is visible to other nodes and is tied to the contracts you sell, purchase, or notarize. Tor will eventually be integrated, but for now privacy-conscious users must either wait for a later release or use a VPN they trust. It is up to each user to comply with local laws and their own conscience.  The client and network will be undergoing constant change during beta. You do have the ability to back up your data, but major changes may force a database reset which may cause lost data or other inconveniences.  There will be bugs; real bitcoin could be lost. Please be aware that that funds could be lost because of a bug or user error. We discourage users from making large transactions with real coins during beta. We aren’t responsible for lost coins, and we’re going to be too busy developing to be able to assist all the individuals who have coins trapped in multisig or otherwise have problems (though we obviously would like to know about the bug).  OpenBazaar is run by part-time volunteers with little funding. Our team is growing, but is still a small group of passionate folks who all have full-time jobs (and most have families as well). We are dedicated to giving the community a platform that finally allows people to trade directly with each other online. This is no small task, and we ask for patience from the community while we fix the bugs and improve the platform. Constructive criticism is very welcome - indeed, it’s a primary goal of beta - but if you disagree with our approach on an issue, feel free to join the team and fix it, or fork the project entirely. Also, we will tend not to respond to basic questions that have already been discussed in our blog posts and documentation.If you understand these points and wish to participate in the beta, then continue reading. I’ll walk you through how to install OpenBazaar, how to run and use the client, and how to report bugs or make suggestions for improvement.How do I install OpenBazaar?Linux and OSXIf you don’t have Git installed in Linux, open terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and type: sudo apt-get install git If you don’t have Git installed for OSX, download here and install. Now run: git clone https://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar.git Once that’s complete, change directories: cd OpenBazaar Run the configure with this command: ./configure.sh If the package doesn’t install correctly, please issue a bug report. You can start and stop OpenBazaar from terminal with the following commands: ./openbazaar start ./openbazaar stopWindowsDownload the Windows binary [signature here], unzip the file and run the OpenBazaar.exe file. In case our site goes down, you can get a torrent with this magnet link.How to runIt may take a few moments to start OpenBazaar, since on the first run it is generating keys pairs for you to use. The program will automatically open a browser with the right address to view the network. You should see a message which gives you warnings about using OpenBazaar during beta. Read them carefully. Now go to your settings, and fill in whatever details you like in the “Store Info” tab.  If you want to give other users more trust that you are an honest player in the network, you can participate in a Reputation Pledge. Please note this burns the coins, so during beta we recommend just a very small amount to test with. In settings, if you go to the “Communication” section on the left, you can put in your email address or Bitmessage address in order to communicate with others on the network.  Once you’ve finished your settings, go to the “Backup” tab and create a new backup. This will store your keys and information in case you need to import them later. Keep those keys safe as if they were bitcoin private keys.  Now you’re ready to use OpenBazaar. You can search for products or stores with the search bar up top. If you find a test product you’d like to practice on, or you want to get a real product, open up the item and click Next. If you see a warning that you don’t have notaries, then go to a store you trust (for testing you can use the seeds), click on “Services,” then “Make Trusted Notary.”  Once they’re trusted, you can go back to a seller’s store and purchase their products, and select the notary you chose. In early beta, there probably isn’t much to find on the network yet, so you should feel welcome to put out your own contracts. Open the “Contract” tab beneath the search bar. Click “Add Contract” and fill in the details. If this contract is just a test, please select note “Test” in the title and description so that others don’t think your offer is a real one.  Once you find an item you want, select your notary and purchase it. Then go to your “My Purchases” drop-down menu under the Orders tab.  Open up your orders, and note that you need to pay the amount listed to the address displayed. This is funding the multisig which needs two of three parties to release. You can pay with your smartphone wallet using the QR code, or hit the “Pay in your Wallet” option to open your Bitcoin wallet and fill out a payment request. Once you’ve paid, be sure to mark the “Mark as Paid” option.  The seller looks at the “My Sales” drop-down menu under the Orders the orders tab, verifies that the buyer has paid (this isn’t automatic yet, so please check the hyperlink for payment), and then ships the product if the multisig has been funded correctly. Once shipped, they mark “Request Payment” and enter their bitcoin address where they want to receive the funds.Tips and TricksHere are a few things that might help you when using OpenBazaar. 1. Be patient. Items such as stores, products, or contracts you’ve published may take a little while to register. Wait a few seconds longer than you think you should need to, and then refresh your page and try again. If it still doesn’t work, then report a bug. Also, finalizing a transaction may take longer than you expect as well. 2. Don’t trust “Paid” as a seller. Right now, the buyer selects “Mark as Paid” to let the seller know when to ship the item. However, they can mark as paid without having actually paid. The seller needs to check the multisig address in the order (which is already hyperlinked) to make sure they actually did pay. In the future the client should check automatically, but for now, seller beware! 3. If you experience trouble connecting to other nodes, stop your node, and port forward 12345 on your router (both TCP and UDP), then try again. 4. We’ll be making frequent changes to the code, so occasionally stop your node, run ‘git pull’ in the OpenBazaar folder to get the most recent changes, and start the node again.Notaries and ArbitrationIf you are beta testing, please familiarise yourself with the concept of notaries and arbitration on OpenBazaar here. In short, the roles for both agents are:  Notaries: to witness contracts between merchants and buyers using a cryptographic digital signature, and manage a bitcoin signing key for a multisignature escrow address in the event of a dispute between the merchant and buyer  Arbiter: to resolve a dispute between a merchant and buyer after careful examination of evidence presented by both partiesFor reasons delineated in the article reference above, these roles should be handled by separate agents. However, only notaries are currently supported. The arbitration market isn’t ready yet. If you want to become a notary to help out the network, you can do this in the settings under the notary tab, by checking the box “Make me a notary.” Please only become a notary if you are willing to:  Automatically witness contracts for other parties          This generally means having your node online close to 24/7        Create and sign multisig transactions for all parties          This means you must have experience with multisignature transactions and are a responsible key manager        Possibly handle disputes between parties          If all goes well, the notary is required to do very little as the client manages contract signing and key creation in the background      In the event of a dispute, the notary must be able to respond to the parties rapidly (i.e. within 24 hours at a maximum)      As the arbitration market is not supported just yet, the notary will also need to wear the hat of an arbiter      Becoming a notary requires you to have some technical knowledge of how to sign, verify, and broadcast multisignature transactions. If you do not know how to do this confidently, please do not become a notary just yet. We expect that notaries will charge a fee for handling disputes or releasing funds from the multisignature escrow address for other reasons. Part of beta will be watching how the notaries are rewarded. Future releases will allow the merchant and buyer to come to a consensus in the selection of a notary to minimise the risk of collusion. If you are a merchant trying to sell real goods for bitcoin, we again urge you to do so cautiously.How do I submit a bug report?There are multiple ways to submit bug reports, depending on what you prefer. If you’re a developer, or are otherwise knowledgeable about Github, you can open an issue there directly. If you’re not a developer or don’t want to use Github, we also have a thread in our subreddit for bugs. Again, please follow the suggested format in the post. We’d like bugs submitted for any problems you run into, but if you see someone else reporting the same bug, you can just make a post noting that you have the same issue (if your OS or browser are different, let us know). Users can feel free to drop into our IRC room at #openbazaar on Freenode (if you don’t have an IRC client use this link). If it’s an installation issue we should be able to walk you through getting your node running properly.How do I make suggestions for improvement?We don’t only want your feedback if something is broken; the point of the beta is to hear from the community on what they want in a peer to peer online trading platform. We encourage users to give us their thoughts on how to make OpenBazaar better. Again, you can open an issue on the Github, though we ask that it is specifically related to the code. For Redditors, we have a thread for suggestions as well.Begin testingThanks for reading, and testing. We’ll be releasing a new beta version each month until we’ve got it running smoothly, then will release a full client. We’ll be doing fixes along the way, so check back occasionally to see if that bug you submitted got fixed. Lastly, come join us on our IRC on Freenode at #openbazaar if you need help, or just want to chat.",

                "title": "Proof-of-burn and Reputation Pledges", 
                "content": "OpenBazaar uses a particular implementation of proof-of-burn that we call Reputation Pledges in order to help build trust among members of the network. This post will give you a quick overview of what this means, why it’s necessary, and how you can use Reputation Pledges yourself.Proof-of-burn Proof-of-burn is a term used to describe the intentional and provable destruction of bitcoin for a particular purpose. When engaging in a proof-of-burn, funds are intentionally sent to an address that is unspendable, meaning those coins are gone forever. Why would someone destroy bitcoin on purpose? In the past, this has primarily been used to bootstrap one cryptocurrency from another. Distribution of a new cryptocurrency can be determined by people burning their coins in exchange for the new currency, thus showing they are invested. For an example of this, read through Counterparty’s explanation of their proof-of-burn.Reputation PledgesOpenBazaar implements proof-of-burn in a different way. On the OpenBazaar network, users can choose to be pseudonymous, meaning you don’t know their true identity. As such, it can sometimes be difficult to determine if they are trustworthy or should be avoided. A reputation system is important to help inform the network of which participants have acted honestly in the past, and which haven’t. There are several facets to the OpenBazaar reputation system, which is still being built, and you can read about the overall system here. One part of this system is Reputation Pledges. This means that a user has chosen to prove their commitment to their OpenBazaar identity by burning a certain amount of bitcoin. The act of burning coins shows the network that the user is committed to their identity because they’ve now expended resources on it, and if they incur a negative reputation then those resources will have gone to waste. To help understand the importance of this, consider a similar example in the real world. Travelling salesmen were often treated with skepticism by the inhabitants of the towns they visited. Apart from the annoyance of their house calls, why would people be reluctant to purchase items from travelling salesmen? Two reasons. One, they cannot rely on reputation to determine if the salesman is selling quality merchandise or not; the other customers of this salesmen aren’t located nearby. Two, the salesman has nothing to lose if their products turn out to be poor quality - there is no reputation damage if they leave, and since there is no brick-and-mortar store they’ve invested in, they can simply peddle their wares elsewhere. You can think of it similarly to OpenBazaar users. If there’s no cost to creating a new identity, or if there is no brick-and-mortar store to keep you in one place, you can simply abandon an identity once it has received negative feedback. Obviously online, you don’t have a physical store, but a Reputation Pledge is a similar concept: you’ve invested resources that create an incentive to keep a good reputation and impose a significant cost for abandoning that reputation.How it worksEngaging in a Reputation Pledge is simple. I’ll have a complete walk-through of this very soon, for now you can view the Reputation Pledge in the “settings” tab.",

                "content": "To help keep the community aware of OpenBazaar’s progress, I will occasionally publish an overview of where we are at in the project. Here’s our first “State of the Code”.Beta ReleaseTwo months ago at the Bitcoin in the Beltway Conference I stood in front of the audience and presented our development roadmap for OpenBazaar. The first major milestone was an ambitious one: Beta Release at the end of August. [caption id=”attachment_60” align=”aligncenter” width=”1023”] Brian presenting at Bitcoin Beltway - Image: Magnus[/caption] When I announced we would be releasing the first beta version of the product I envisioned a fairly small scope and was leveraging the teamwork of just a few individuals. Fortunately, since then our team has grown in size and expertise and that scope has grown. This will make OpenBazaar much more viable as a scalable and powerful solution. Therefore, we have decided to migrate from a simplified Beta then Full Release schedule to a much more nimble and continuous development process. This means that instead of simply launching a product and hoping the community finds it valuable, we are now able to continually work on the development and incorporate feedback from the community as we move forward. If you’ve been looking forward to testing OpenBazaar out, don’t worry: we will be releasing a version of the software that can be installed on Mac OSX, Linux and Windows on August 31st. As it’s the first Beta, it will be fairly limited in functionality and Sam Patterson will be posting a more detailed outline of this when we release.Other updatesI won’t even try to list all the developments and progress we’ve made since this project began. To summarize, we have been encouraged by the community support displayed, which has increased our appetite for making this project succeed.Team Member Updates[caption id=”attachment_61” align=”aligncenter” width=”857”] OpenBazaar Team Members[/caption] We are so excited to have so many great people helping out the project, and to see the number of contributors continue to increase. All of our team members participate for no payment and have contributed a massive amount of personal effort and time to get us where we are now, and for that I know I am grateful and I am pledging as much as I can to the project as well. If you know of others who are interested in assisting, please get in touch with us at project@openbazaar.org so that we can help you figure out where it would be possible.Formalizing the OrganizationOur team is currently looking at different ways to legitimize the project in ways that would benefit the community as a whole. We are not quite sure how this will happen, but rest assured our principles of zero fee operation and openness will remain. That being said, we are considering ways to bolster development and operational support in ways other than a funding address. We will let everyone know if any decisions are made one way or another.PartnershipsOver the last few months we have received many emails and messages from businesses small and large, who want to start using OpenBazaar as soon as possible. As we approach the Public Release of OpenBazaar at the end of the year (notional), we will be working with groups to line up some Day 1 merchants, notaries, and arbitration participants. If you are interested in this process please contact us at project@openbazaar.org so that we can get you on our follow up list and help you find out more about how this will work. We have also been approached daily by almost every altcoin outside of Doge to incorporate it into the project. For the record, we aim to support altcoins capable of multisignature transactions. However, we have no definite timeline for altcoin support to give at this time. Many of you have donated to the cause (over 5 BTC raised), contributed to our development or written articles or tweets about us and we thank you graciously for all of that.Final CommentsOverall, the project is heading in a great direction. With the Bitcoin community’s help (and patience), we can deliver a product that will change how we use our Bitcoin for the better. Our goal remains simple: provide an easy to use application that anyone in the world can use to spend Bitcoin (or other crypto-currencies) on goods and services without an intermediary. There is no one way to accomplish this goal. We hope to innovate and inspire others to follow our lead in creating more decentralized services so that we can one day live and interact with each other with true freedom.-- Brian Hoffman Project Lead",
