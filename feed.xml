In this article we want to talk about &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we’re integrating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ethereum.org/&quot;&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bitcoin-beginnings&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Beginnings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenBazaar began as a Bitcoin-only project, with the intent of creating an open, permissionless marketplace with no fees and no middlemen. From the beginning users wanted the ability to accept payments in cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin. While that was possible via our &lt;a href=&quot;https://shapeshift.io/&quot;&gt;Shapeshift&lt;/a&gt; integration, such payments weren’t really trustless. Non-bitcoin payments would just be Shapeshifted into bitcoin payments. Users effectively had to use Shapeshift as a middleman, had to trust them not to steal their funds, and had to pay them for the privilege. In that sense, non-bitcoin payments weren’t really &lt;em&gt;native&lt;/em&gt; to OpenBazaar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, in late 2017, bitcoin transaction fees began to rise. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.htm&quot;&gt;A lot&lt;/a&gt;. Using bitcoin for payments on OpenBazaar became impractical for months. Since payments in non-bitcoin currencies weren’t native on OpenBazaar (they were simply Shapefshifted into bitcoin payments) that meant &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; payments on OpenBazaar were impractical. Users wanted to use alternative currencies, but we were – effectively – forcing them to use bitcoin. Use of the platform ground to a halt. It was obvious something needed to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;becoming-crypto-inclusive&quot;&gt;Becoming Crypto-Inclusive&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want users to be able to trade using &lt;strong&gt;any cryptocurrency they desire&lt;/strong&gt;, without exposure to risks caused by other chains. In early 2018, in response to urgent demand from our users, we began integrating native altcoin payments into OpenBazaar. We’re refactoring our codebase to make it much easier to integrate new cryptocurrencies natively. The low hanging fruits are coins that are forks of Bitcoin, as their codebases are closest to what OpenBazaar was already supporting. Bitcoin Cash and Zcash were the first such integrations, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://litecoin.org/&quot;&gt;Litecoin&lt;/a&gt; integration is almost complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enter-ethereum&quot;&gt;Enter Ethereum&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A natural continuation of that effort is to integrate Ethereum. Since Ethereum doesn’t share Bitcoin’s codebase, it has been more challenging to integrate than forks of Bitcoin. But we think it’s worth the effort because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ethereum has the largest community outside of Bitcoin.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developer activity on Ethereum is huge and enthusiastic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The community has a special eagerness for its coin and tokens to be used for real-world commerce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating &lt;strong&gt;ETH&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;ERC20 payments&lt;/strong&gt; is a natural next-step for OpenBazaar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond simple payments, &lt;strong&gt;smart contracts&lt;/strong&gt; built on Ethereum – with its rich Turing-complete scripting language – may allow us to support markets that would be extremely challenging to support with Bitcoin-like script-based cryptocurrencies. Trustless auctions, DAO-based stores, insurance contracts, and affiliate marketing are just a few of the ideas we are exploring. Integrating Ethereum has the potential expand the types of products and services offered on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users won’t be required to use Ethereum to use OpenBazaar, and can still stick to paying and being paid in Bitcoin or other supported cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;in-summary&quot;&gt;In Summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the landscape isn’t what is was when OpenBazaar first started. There is a rich ecosystem we cannot afford to ignore, and Ethereum is a huge part of that. We’re excited about implementing ETH and ERC20 payments, and are looking forward to working with the Ethereum community as we explore how we can leverage smart contracts in OpenBazaar.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In a previous article we explained how we’re integrating Ethereum into OpenBazaar in addition to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Zcash.

&lt;p&gt;The integration of Ethereum into OpenBazaar represents one of the most challenging and rewarding tasks we’ve done for the project so far. We are so excited to bring our vision of seeing cryptocurrency and tokens used for real-world commerce to the Ethereum community!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org&quot;&gt;OpenBazaar&lt;/a&gt; facilitates trades between arbitrary third parties on the internet. Currently, only UTXO-based cryptocurrencies can be used as a medium of exchange on OpenBazaar. The escrow contract is intended to be used as a way to shoehorn Ethereum functionality into OpenBazaar’s existing framework so that users can trade using ETH and ERC20 tokens as their medium of exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-openbazaar-trades-currently-work-in-utxo-land&quot;&gt;How OpenBazaar Trades Currently Work (in UTXO land)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;moderated-payments&quot;&gt;Moderated Payments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a buyer and seller have agreed on a product and a price, the buyer sends their funds to an escrow address, which is a 2-of-3 multisig address with one key controlled by the buyer, one key controlled by the seller, and one key controlled by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/how-to-choose-a-good-moderator-on-openbazaar&quot;&gt;moderator&lt;/a&gt; that has been agreed upon by both the buyer and the seller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the “happy path”, the seller delivers the goods, then the buyer releases the funds to the seller (with the buyer and seller signing the payout transaction from the escrow address).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event that the seller does not deliver the goods as promised, the buyer pleads their case to the moderator, and the buyer &amp;amp; moderator can send the funds from escrow back to the buyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the (very common) case where the buyer receives their goods but doesn’t release the funds to the seller, the seller presents their case to the moderator, and the seller &amp;amp; moderator sign the funds from escrow to the seller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seller can also unilaterally release funds from escrow after a previously agreed upon amount of time has passed. This allows the seller to release the funds from escrow without the moderator in the event that the buyer disappears. With UTXO-based coins, this is achieved by requiring that the buyer sign an nLockTime transaction releasing funds to the seller, and then passing that transaction to the seller (off-chain) before the seller delivers the product or service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;direct-payments&quot;&gt;Direct Payments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buyers have the option of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; using a moderator when making an OpenBazaar trade. While this isn’t recommended, it may be an acceptable risk for the buyer if the buyer trusts the seller. Direct or unmoderated payments come in two forms: online payments and offline payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online direct payments&lt;/strong&gt; occur when the buyer knows the seller is online. For online payments, the buyer simply sends the funds directly to the seller’s wallet after requesting an address to pay to. These are simple, classic transfers of value from one account to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offline payments&lt;/strong&gt; occur when the buyer sees that the seller is offline and is &lt;em&gt;uncertain&lt;/em&gt; whether the seller will ever come back online. In this case the buyer sends the funds to a 1-of-2 multisig address with one key held by the buyer and the other held by the seller. If the seller comes back online, they can accept the funds. If the seller doesn’t come back online, the buyer can reclaim the funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations Imposed by OpenBazaar’s Wallet Interface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenBazaar interacts with all supported coins through its &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenBazaar/wallet-interface/blob/master/wallet.go#L77&quot;&gt;wallet interface&lt;/a&gt;. This means that OpenBazaar’s Ethereum smart contracts must be designed in such a way as to be compatible with that interface. OpenBazaar is a live/launched product, so making big changes to the wallet interface in order to support Ethereum is non-trivial. Instead, we’ve decided to keep the wallet interface fixed (for now), and design the smart contract to be compatible with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intended-use-of-the-escrow-contract&quot;&gt;Intended Use of the Escrow contract&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Escrow contract will store the escrowed funds and state information for &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; OpenBazaar trade that is using Ethereum (or ERC20 tokens) as the medium of exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could have, instead, opted to deploy a new escrow contract for each Ethereum-based trade — thereby siloing escrowed funds from each trade in their own smart contract. However, we think the gas requirements for doing so are cost prohibitive, and we fear that would introduce too much friction into Ethereum-based trades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenBazaar trades that use ETH/ERC20 as the medium of exchange are intended to follow the same protocol as those that use a UTXO-based coin as the medium of exchange — and the escrow smart contract is intended to facilitate that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;funding-the-trade&quot;&gt;Funding the Trade&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buyers initiate a trade by creating/storing a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Transaction&lt;/code&gt; struct in the Escrow contract and (simultaneously) funding the transaction by sending ETH (or ERC20 tokens) to the Escrow contract. At this point the transaction is in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FUNDED&lt;/code&gt; state. While in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FUNDED&lt;/code&gt; state, the buyer may add more ETH (or ERC20 tokens) to escrow if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;releasing-funds-from-escrow&quot;&gt;Releasing Funds from Escrow&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the transaction is in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FUNDED&lt;/code&gt; state, the escrowed funds can be released only if:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two of the three participants (buyer, seller, and moderator) agree on how the escrowed funds are to be distributed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An amount of time (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;timeoutHourse&lt;/code&gt;) has passed since the last time the buyer added funds to escrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasoning behind (2) is that it is very common for buyers to not release funds after they’ve received their goods (this is due more to buyer laziness than malice). In that event, we want to make it easy for the seller to claim the escrowed funds without having to coordinate with a moderator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funds released from escrow can be split up and sent to various addresses. However, the receiving addresses &lt;em&gt;must be&lt;/em&gt; the addresses of the trade’s buyer, seller, or moderator. To reiterate, funds cannot be sent to an address that is not affiliated with the trade in question, but the escrowed funds can be divided up among the participants in any way — so long as 2-of-3 of the parties agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon release of funds from escrow, the trade is put into the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RELEASED&lt;/code&gt; state. Once in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RELEASED&lt;/code&gt; state, trades can no longer be altered. All participants who received some of the escrowed funds are noted in the trade’s Transaction struct (via the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beneficiaries&lt;/code&gt; mapping).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beneficiaries&lt;/code&gt; information will be used later, by other contracts, to determine whether or not a given trade was disputed, refunded, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;offline-direct-payments&quot;&gt;Offline Direct Payments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The escrow contract can mirror the behavior of UTXO-based offline payments by calling &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;addTransaction&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;addTokenTransaction&lt;/code&gt; if it is an ERC20 transaction), setting the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;threshold&lt;/code&gt; value to 1, and setting the moderator address to a known, non-zero burn address. The effect is the equivalent of a 1-of-2 multisig address where the buyer holds one key and the seller holds the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;known-issues--misc&quot;&gt;Known Issues / Misc&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;moderator-selection&quot;&gt;Moderator selection&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is assumed that the moderator is &lt;em&gt;trusted&lt;/em&gt; by both the buyer and the seller before the trade begins. The obvious threat of collusion between a buyer and moderator — or seller and moderator — is beyond the scope of this contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;push-vs-pull&quot;&gt;Push vs pull&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;transferFunds&lt;/code&gt; function uses push payments (rather than the pull model) due to limitations imposed by OpenBazaar’s wallet interface. Hence any of the beneficiaries of a payout from escrow can cause the payout to fail (for example, by putting a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;revert()&lt;/code&gt; in their fallback function).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game theoretically speaking, such a DoS attack is irrational for any of the participants capable of causing such an issue, because the honest parties can always benefit by removing the offending party as a beneficiary and taking her share of the payout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose the three parties agreed that the moderator would received 5% of the funds, and that the buyer and seller would split the remaining funds. The seller, being unhappy with the result, could cause the payout to fail until she could negotiate a more favorable agreement. However, the buyer &amp;amp; moderator — upon seeing the seller’s misbehavior — could simply agree to remove the seller as a beneficiary — thus removing the seller’s ability to DoS the payout.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, we consider the DoS possibility caused by use of push payments in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;transferFunds&lt;/code&gt; function to be low risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quality-assurance&quot;&gt;Quality assurance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code for the escrow smart contract can be found in Github &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenBazaar/smart-contracts/blob/master/contracts/escrow/Escrow_v1_0.sol&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We invite the community to examine the code and post issues or suggestions. Furthermore, we have written 37 tests for the contract to achieve &amp;gt;90% code coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;audit&quot;&gt;Audit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://openzeppelin.org/&quot;&gt;OpenZeppelin&lt;/a&gt; to have the contracts audited and hope to have the audit process completed before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

This is an ideal time for new developers to get involved in OpenBazaar and become familiar with the codebase. Don’t wait long! Some of these issues have been snatched up already, and we’re already more than halfway through October.&lt;/p&gt;

(Or Bitcoin Cash, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://z.cash/&quot;&gt;Zcash&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of things on OpenBazaar! It is a marketplace where you can buy and sell what you want and connect to people all around the world who are using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are 3 great stores for you to shop at today:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;casa-store&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com/store/Qmd9hFFuueFrSR7YwUuAfirXXJ7ANZAMc5sx4HFxn7mPkc&quot;&gt;Casa Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Casa_Store_on_OpenBazaar.png&quot; alt=&quot;Casa Store on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Casa Store on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com/store/Qmd9hFFuueFrSR7YwUuAfirXXJ7ANZAMc5sx4HFxn7mPkc&quot;&gt;Casa Store on OpenBazaar&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Casa began as a personal key management system then expanded to help their customers with hardware solutions as well. They are an Authorized Reseller for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ledger.com/&quot;&gt;Ledger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://trezor.io/&quot;&gt;Trezor&lt;/a&gt; and in September this year they expanded again. They began pre-releases for their brand new &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com/store/Qmd9hFFuueFrSR7YwUuAfirXXJ7ANZAMc5sx4HFxn7mPkc/casa-lightning-node&quot;&gt;Lightning Nodes&lt;/a&gt; and sold out the first two shipment waves in the first day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;em&gt;lucky you&lt;/em&gt;, it does seem that December shipments are still available on OpenBazaar…
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;crypto-greeting-cards&quot;&gt;Crypto Greeting Cards&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Crypto_Greeting_Cards_on_OpenBazaar.png&quot; alt=&quot;Crypto Greeting Cards on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Crypto Greeting Cards on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com/store/QmbmytVomWgsBW74QgyPdh17adoPBJeo2g7scihNPAjMmy&quot;&gt;Crypto Greeting Cards on OpenBazaar&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you are seeking high-quality, cryptocurrency-themed greeting cards for your fellow crypto-enthusiasts, they’ve got you covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want greeting cards that allow you to easily give the gift of cryptocurrency along with practical educational materials, they’ve &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; got you covered!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what they say about their store:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“After being tired of the stacks of mundane, generic store-brand greeting cards, we set out to pair our passion in cryptocurrency with designs inspired by the community. Each card features a pre-generated cryptocurrency wallet that can be transferred to the recipient. Like cash in an envelope, only better. The goal is to inspire new participants to join the financial revolution!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crypto Greeting Cards are an affordable way to introduce friends, family, and loved ones to cryptocurrency. After redeeming the card, the recipient will learn:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to set up a wallet app&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The difference between public address and private key&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;An introduction to transactions (sweeping funds)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is there any better way to spread cryptocurrency than kind words and a small gift?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think not.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;crypto-republic---bch&quot;&gt;Crypto Republic - BCH&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Spend your Bitcoin Cash on some great items from apparel to video games at Crypto Republic. They have a lot of great information about who they are and what they stand for and how to get around OpenBazaar on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com/store/home/QmU5ZSKVz2GhsqE6EmBGVCtrui4YhUXny6rbvsSf5h2xvH&quot;&gt;About page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

You’ll learn how to buy cryptocurrency with a different cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin. At the moment OpenBazaar doesn’t support people buying cryptocurrency with regular fiat money such as US Dollars or Euros, though it’s a feature that will hopefully be supported in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a video tutorial explaining the process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mb-5&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe class=&quot;embed-responsive-item&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/q6ki3_1Io-U&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-download-openbazaar&quot;&gt;Step #1: Download OpenBazaar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/download&quot;&gt;OpenBazaar.org&lt;/a&gt; and click on the installer link for your operating system. Once the installer file is downloaded, open the file and it will begin the process of installing OpenBazaar.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-select-cryptocurrency&quot;&gt;Step #2: Select cryptocurrency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be asked which cryptocurrency you want to use. This is the cryptocurrency that you will pay with as a buyer, or receive as a seller. This is not the currency that you wish to purchase.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;selectingcurrency.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Select Purchasing Cryptocurrency&quot; title=&quot;Select Purchasing Cryptocurrency&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
At the moment OpenBazaar users are limited to using only one cryptocurrency at a time, and can only choose BTC, BCH, or ZEC. However in the near future users will be able to use multiple currencies at the same time, and will have LTC, ETH, and other coins available to use.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-complete-onboarding&quot;&gt;Step #3: Complete Onboarding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go through the onboarding process and enter whatever information you choose. If you want to remain private then keep the randomly generated name assigned to you. Choose the currency you want to have prices displayed in; you’ll want this to be the currency that you most commonly use so that the prices of goods and services are familiar to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the terms of service, and if you agree then accept them.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;onboarding.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Complete Onboarding&quot; title=&quot;Complete Onboarding&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-4-search-for-cryptocurrency-listings&quot;&gt;Step #4: Search for cryptocurrency listings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re now up and running on OpenBazaar, so let’s find some cryptocurrency listings. Click the “Discover” button on the top right of the client (the blue tent). After selecting a search provider, you’ll now see lots of listings on the network. To filter down to only cryptocurrency offerings, use the search provider’s filters on the left. You’ll now see a list of cryptocurrencies for sale. Find what you want and click on the listing to view it.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;searchcurrency.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Search for Cryptocurrency&quot; title=&quot;Search for Cryptocurrency&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-5-buy-the-cryptocurrency&quot;&gt;Step #5: Buy the cryptocurrency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s recommended that you find a vendor who has a “Verified Moderator” on their listings. This means you will be able to choose escrow from a reputable third party. You can tell if they offer a verified moderator by looking for a little orange badge underneath the seller’s name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve found some crypto you want to buy, click the “Trade now” button to start the checkout process. You’ll need to enter a receiving address for the funds you’re buying. As in the example below, if you’re buying Decred then you’ll need to put in a Decred address that you control where the seller will send the cryptocurrency you buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then choose payment type. Unless you fully trust the vendor, you should use a moderated payment with a verified moderator. Enter the amount you wish to buy, then review your order and click “Pay.” You’ll now see the payment screen.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;examplepurchase.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Buy the Cryptocurrency&quot; title=&quot;Buy the Cryptocurrency&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-6-send-payment&quot;&gt;Step #6: Send Payment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve placed the order you now need to pay for it. There are two ways to pay in OpenBazaar. One is by scanning the QR code on a mobile wallet or copying the details on the payment screen into a separate wallet and sending payment. The other method is using the internal OpenBazaar wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t want to use a separate wallet, or you try using an external wallet and you receive an error message, then it’s best to use the internal OpenBazaar wallet and click the “Pay from Wallet” button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you can pay from the OpenBazaar wallet, you’ll need to fund it. To do this, click on the wallet button, then in the wallet interface click “Receive Money.” This will display a QR code and address you can use to fund the wallet. Note that you’ll need to wait for one confirmation on the blockchain before the funds are spendable.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;obwalletreceive.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Receive funds in OpenBazaar Wallet&quot; title=&quot;Receive funds in OpenBazaar Wallet&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To pay for orders you’ve already placed, click on “Purchases” in the dropdown menu on the top right (your profile picture) and then click on the specific order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once payment has been sent you’ll see a green check mark appear and it’s now up to the vendor to fulfill your order.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-7-check-your-order&quot;&gt;Step #7: Check your order&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check your order, click on “Purchases” in the dropdown menu on the top right (your profile picture) and then click on the specific order. You’ll see a bar showing the progress of the order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the seller fulfills the order you should see it showing “fulfilled,” and the vendor should send confirmation such as a transaction hash to prove they sent the funds to the address you provided. Enter the transaction hash into a block explorer to verify, or just check the wallet where you expected the funds to be sent. If you’ve received them, leave a review and close the order out. It’s important that you do finish the order, otherwise the funds will not be released from escrow and the seller will be forced to open a dispute to claim their funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t receive the funds in a reasonable period, message the seller to ask why. If you get no response after a while or something else is wrong with your order, you can choose to open a dispute with the moderator by clicking the “Dispute Order” button when viewing the order in your purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenBazaar is also a platform for goods and services. While you’re waiting for the vendor to send your new coins, check out what the marketplace has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you know how to purchase cryptocurrencies privately and with no fees using OpenBazaar.&lt;/p&gt;

What about when the price shoots up and we know how valuable it can be if we hodl it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s a broad definition of a currency:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Something (such as coins, treasury notes, and banknotes) that is in circulation as a medium of exchange.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A currency can be anything that multiple people agree has value and they’re willing to exchange for other things, such as goods or services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, how do you know that a t-shirt is worth $20? It’s because that’s a generally accepted market price, which leads to you and a specific vendor trading a shirt for $20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;do-cryptocurrencies-have-value-we-can-measure&quot;&gt;Do cryptocurrencies have value we can measure?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, cryptocurrencies that are traded on exchanges have value measured next to national currencies so you can track their value at any given time. They also have value on their own, but due to their newness most people make sense of cryptocurrency values in terms of other existing currencies. For now it’s still easier to understand what exchanging $20 for a t-shirt means rather than “0.0031 BTC.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are &lt;strong&gt;4 reasons why you should buy things with your cryptocurrency!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit stores from around the world&lt;/strong&gt; where people just like you, who believe in the power of cryptocurrency, are working on their entrepreneurial hustle. Some people are selling on OpenBazaar because they don’t have access to other online marketplaces due to the cost of participating or restrictions based on their location. Some users are also on OpenBazaar because their products are very fringe or niche such as religious objects or political items. It’s exciting to see how a decentralized marketplace can connect all types of people!

&lt;p&gt;Each time you buy something on a large e-commerce platform with a credit card you are forced to share your personal data with multiple companies, who then add this data into a profile they’ve built about you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While cryptocurrencies don’t offer complete privacy, they are more private than credit cards. By purchasing on a platform like OpenBazaar &lt;strong&gt;you never share personal data with a centralized platform&lt;/strong&gt;, only with the vendor you are purchasing a physical item from. If you purchase digital goods or services you aren’t forced to give any personal information at all.

&lt;p&gt;We have seen ups and downs with the cryptocurrency market but we’re not in this because of the speculation frenzy. We’re in this because it is the ground floor of a huge technological revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crypto-commerce still has a way to go but we don’t get to the future we believe in by waiting—we get there by doing. The OpenBazaar development team believes this and built this decentralized marketplace specifically to utilize the special qualities of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line is we like cryptocurrency and we want to see it put to work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t you like to use money that lets you be in control of it? Money with values set by markets around the world, not exclusively by too-big-to-fail banks and questionable governments?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who are buying and selling on OpenBazaar &lt;strong&gt;believe in using cryptocurrencies AS currencies&lt;/strong&gt; to exchange for goods and services they need or want. If you believe this too, then OpenBazaar is a great place for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a &lt;em&gt;decentralized&lt;/em&gt; online marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenBazaar is like its own separate part of the internet. It’s a network of users who connect directly to one another instead of to centralized websites like Amazon or Ebay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decentralized architecture that makes it powerful can also make it a bit hard to understand at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ob1.io&quot;&gt;OB1&lt;/a&gt;, the team leading the development of OpenBazaar, has designed a few things that make it easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These items are add-ons and are &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-decentralization/&quot;&gt;less decentralized&lt;/a&gt; than the network itself. They make shopping easier but they do not change the decentralized protocol nor the privacy or security of your transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/decentralized-search-and-content-discovery-on-openbazaar/&quot;&gt;search engines&lt;/a&gt; within the application that help you discover items. OB1 created the first search engine but anyone is welcome to build one and make it available for others to add to their own OpenBazaar instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With OB1 search you can choose from a selection of suggested categories or search by shipping location, coin payment type, moderator type, or rating. You can also toggle adult filters on and off or search within different product types including physical goods, cryptocurrencies, digital goods, and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging technology that focuses on decentralizing the Internet is exciting, but still new. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/how-decentralized-application-development-nearly-destroyed-my-world/&quot;&gt;many challenges to overcome when building decentralized applications&lt;/a&gt; but we are optimistic about industry progress.

&lt;p&gt;E-commerce is an exciting and flexible way to start your own business. With some e-commerce business models you can even earn money from the comfort of your own home. While there are many opportunities to get started, there are also many ways to get lost in the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;OpenBazaar Store on OpenBazaar.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Store on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar Store on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With OpenBazaar, the world’s largest decentralized marketplace, you can build your store and listings faster than on any other network. We have some tips that will help your store stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have something you’ve been itching to sell on OpenBazaar, here are 5 tips to help make your listings &lt;strong&gt;POP&lt;/strong&gt; on the network! 🎈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Creating Listing Tags on OpenBazaar.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Creating a Listing Title on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Creating a Listing Title on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-write-a-descriptive-title&quot;&gt;1. Write a descriptive title&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your title should give your buyers a clear idea of what you’re selling. When writing a title, try throwing in a few descriptive keywords to give your listing some extra oomph. For example, “hand-crafted pure copper jug with lid” is a lot more interesting and helpful than just “water jug”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-take-many-many-photos-&quot;&gt;2. Take many, many photos 📸&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a picture is worth a thousand words and you can attach up to 30 photos for every listing, that should save you 30,000 words (and way too many headaches), right? Take advantage of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photos are arguably the most important part of a listing – it’s the closest a buyer can come to seeing your product in person. Take clear, high-quality pictures in plenty of light to really let your product shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Simple Listing Image on OpenBazaar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Simple Listing Image on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Simple Listing Image on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;get-rid-of-background-clutter&quot;&gt;Get rid of background clutter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t detract from the star of the show. Stage your product against a plain background. This removes distractions and allows your product to stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIP:&lt;/strong&gt; Can’t find a good plain surface anywhere? Textured surfaces can also work well. Place your product on marble counters and wooden coffee tables. Or, just hang up a bedsheet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;give-us-variety&quot;&gt;Give us variety&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show us how your product looks with different angles and settings. Snap some closeups to capture unique and intricate details. Showcase your product in action. If you’re selling a t-shirt, take photos of the shirt on a model so your buyers can see how much cooler it looks on a human being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to include photos of variants too! If you’re selling the same dress in red, white, and black, show us what each of them looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Dress Variations on OpenBazaar.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dress Variations on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Dress Variations on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;choose-your-primary-photo&quot;&gt;Choose your primary photo&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your primary photo is the first thing a buyer will see when they find your listing. It’s both the thumbnail image and the cover photo on your listing’s main page. You want to make a stellar first impression, so use your most captivating photo as your listing’s primary photo. To do this, click your chosen photo and drag it left to the the first spot in the list of pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Setting Your Primary Listing Photo on OpenBazaar.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Setting Your Primary Listing Photo on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Setting Your Primary Listing Photo on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, your primary photo should capture your product as a whole. So instead of a close-up detail shot, try to choose a photo that shows your product in full view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-give-us-the-deets-&quot;&gt;3. Give us the deets ☕&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details are key, so don’t skimp on product descriptions! Start with the basics first: what’s for sale?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Handmade red mini tassel earrings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vintage whiskey decanter set with matching glasses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Age Beets headphones: powered purely by organic beet juice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, go into more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;colour&quot;&gt;Colour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colours are deceivingly hard to convey through photos. How a shade looks can vary wildly depending on lighting, or the kind of device you’re using to view it. Give your buyers a more accurate understanding of an item’s colour by using more specific descriptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, instead of “red”, try:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vermillion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crimson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raspberry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Burgundy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Image from Ingrid Sundberg’s Colour Thesaurus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;size&quot;&gt;Size&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bust out the tape measure so you can let people know how big or small your item is. If you’re selling clothing, it’s helpful to include a size guide like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Example of a Size Guide on OpenBazaar.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of a Size Guide on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Example of a Size Guide on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;material&quot;&gt;Material&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s your product made of? Stainless steel, copper, wood, bamboo… If this lip balm features beeswax collected from your own personal backyard apiary, be sure to let your buyers know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-to-use&quot;&gt;How to use&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give us some instructions on how to use and care for your product. For example: Where should it be stored? Is it dishwasher safe or hand wash only? Can I toss it in the dryer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspire your buyers. Show them different ways to use your product. If you’re selling a scarf, offer a few examples for how they can wear and style that scarf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, you can also give them some ideas for how a product might fit into their lives –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Kindle would be a great gift for your neighborhood bookworm who may or may not have a hoarding problem!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does your cat take massive poops? Our double-duty clothespin doubles as a nostril clamp!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absolutely irresistible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-break-up-long-blocks-of-text&quot;&gt;4. Break up long blocks of text&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product descriptions or store policies can get lengthy. Don’t make your buyer slog through line after line of text. Instead, format your content to help them find the information they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;write-short-paragraphs&quot;&gt;Write short paragraphs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep your paragraphs to 3-5 lines max. If you have a lot to communicate, try organizing the content into sections with header titles. It will make the information much less intimidating and easier to digest. For example, in your product description, you can have sections for &lt;em&gt;key features&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;dimensions&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;care instructions&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;use-bullet-points&quot;&gt;Use bullet points&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullet points are your friends! They’re easy to read and convey a lot of information very quickly. Use them when you can. They’re especially helpful when listing product features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;format-your-text&quot;&gt;Format your text&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little text formatting can go a long way. Call out important tidbits in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt; so they don’t get lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;add-visuals&quot;&gt;Add visuals&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get creative! Break up your text with photos and GIFs. Visuals can add an instant POP to your content, making it dynamic and engaging. For example, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com/store/QmU5ZSKVz2GhsqE6EmBGVCtrui4YhUXny6rbvsSf5h2xvH/mini-metro-cd-key-steam&quot;&gt;this listing by Crypto Republic - BCH&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; OpenBazaar doesn’t store images that you can include in the description. You need to store them somewhere else on the internet and use their URL to add them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-add-tags-to-get-your-listing-discovered&quot;&gt;5. Add &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/how-to-get-more-buyers-on-openbazaar-with-categories-and-tags&quot;&gt;tags&lt;/a&gt; to get your listing discovered!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Creating Listing Tags on OpenBazaar.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Creating Listing Tags on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Creating Listing Tags on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, make sure you tag your products so people can find them on the network. You’ve put a lot of blood and sweat into creating this listing, so you deserve to get some eyeballs on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When tagging your listing, try to think like a shopper – if you were looking for a product like this, what kind of search terms would you use? Some questions you can ask yourself include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-would-a-shopper-describe-this-item&quot;&gt;How would a shopper describe this item?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if I were looking for a pair of green earrings, I might search:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jewelery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earrings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Studs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Green&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emerald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-would-a-shopper-be-looking-for-this-item&quot;&gt;Why would a shopper be looking for this item?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a shopper, I might not know exactly what I’m looking for. I could be shopping for a gift for my mom. In that case, I might search:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gifts for her&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mother’s day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get lost in the ecommerce crowd. Make sure your OpenBazaar listings are optimized with great titles, photos, details, formatting and tags so that shoppers are so delighted to discover them they can’t help but buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your listings are all set up, make sure to find your store link on the web at &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com&quot;&gt;openbazaar.com&lt;/a&gt; so you can share them with your audience on social media! It may take a bit for them to show up there so please be patient.&lt;/p&gt;
