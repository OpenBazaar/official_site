To read a summary of the last year, read &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/big-change-hard-work-and-strong-growth-openbazaar-2-turns-1/&quot;&gt;Brian Hoffman’s piece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenBazaar started more than four years ago, and for everyone involved it has been an incredible learning experience. Here are a few lessons we’ve learned over the years, with a particular emphasis on the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-expect-politics&quot;&gt;1. Expect politics.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like Bitcoin, OpenBazaar is an open source piece of software and a network of people running the software. As such, it’s incapable of having a “position” on any given issue. However, the individuals and companies building OpenBazaar do have opinions about issues in the cryptocurrency space. When they promote these beliefs – particularly on controversial issues – others will often claim “OpenBazaar believes X” instead of correctly attributing the opinion to the individual or company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we started building OpenBazaar in mid-2014 the community of people using cryptocurrencies was smaller, primarily focused on Bitcoin, and the majority of people agreed that building infrastructure in order to use cryptocurrency was worthwhile and necessary for broader adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few years the community got larger and also began to disagree on the future of Bitcoin, such as how (or even if) it should scale. OpenBazaar itself played no role in this “scaling debate,” remaining neutral and following whichever chain the market decided upon. While the project itself was neutral, the individuals and companies working on OpenBazaar weren’t. In the new tribalist atmosphere created during the block size debate, this caused many to ascribe the individual positions of developers to the project itself, leading some to withdrawal their support and no longer use the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For better or worse, the cryptocurrency space has become politicized over the past few years, and we now recognize the importance of emphasizing the project’s neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-plan-for-all-possible-future-scenariosincluding-unfavorable-ones&quot;&gt;2. Plan for all possible future scenarios—including unfavorable ones.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lesson learned is also related to the scaling debate mentioned above. We recognized the possibility that fees could get high enough to prevent people from using Bitcoin for commerce. As individuals and as a company we supported efforts to keep Bitcoin functioning and not get to that point. Unfortunately, it happened anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the day OpenBazaar 2.0 launched the average Bitcoin fee was ~$5 per transaction and rising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though we already knew high fees were a possibility, this all happened in a very short timeframe and forced us to react as quickly as possible. Since Bitcoin &lt;strong&gt;wasn’t usable for commerce at that moment&lt;/strong&gt;, we decided to add support for new, usable cryptocurrencies into the client immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This put us in the situation of publishing a Bitcoin-only product in November of 2017 and then needing to put all our development efforts into making it a multi-coin product immediately afterwards, which was several months of work. Had we decided at the beginning to build OpenBazaar 2.0 with support for multiple coins it likely would have been simpler and the resulting UX would have been better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing about future scenarios and trying to make or prevent them from happening isn’t sufficient. You need to have plans in place for facing whatever reality meets your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-dont-get-overly-focused-on-a-single-product&quot;&gt;3. Don’t get overly focused on a single product.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenBazaar is a desktop application. This is primarily for technical reasons; building a completely peer-to-peer application is tough for desktop only and even more so in a web browser or on a mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second reason is due to momentum. We started on desktop and have continued iterating on desktop because, while it has been a difficult undertaking, it was one we became very familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com&quot;&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ob1.io/&quot;&gt;mobile&lt;/a&gt; are implementations we are actively working on and have dreamed of realizing since the beginning, but they require very different engineering approaches and even philosophies. For them to begin development we had to deliberately choose to direct significant resources to them and many of the decisions made along these paths have not been easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web-connected technology is evolving quickly now and organizations working in a sector like cryptocurrencies need to demonstrate 2 extremes: &lt;strong&gt;focus&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;. People are solving hard problems every day using this very new technology while also facing a growing market with changing desires. They need to be both steadfast &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; nimble to tackle each day that may change all of their grandest plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve learned a lot about developing open source software, managing a community and dealing with the changes and growth of cryptocurrencies over the past few years, and we certainly haven’t been perfect. We appreciate the knowledge we have gained, and are executing against it in our daily work. We look forward to learning much more as we continue building the largest and most free decentralized ecommerce platform on the internet with you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This month we’ve been celebrating the one year anniversary of OpenBazaar 2.0.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chat log:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[09:59] mg: Hi kornilov. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:00] mg: Heard you learned how to feed chickens over the internet with magic internet money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:00] kornilov: Hi developers and Jenn. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:02] kornilov: Yes, I have learned to make ethereum testnet token - korncoin ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:02] mg: I was unaware of that! I was talking about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/redpepper261&quot;&gt;BCH chicken feeder/webcam&lt;/a&gt;. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:04] kornilov: Oh, that is supposed to be a secret project available only for NSA. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:04] mg: Haha… I’ll make sure to keep my lips sealed. :X&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:10] joshj: One minor clarification, ETH uses Infura, not Insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:19] chris.troutner: 18!? That’s fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:20] Rod: Is there a general timeline/estimate for when 2.3 will be released?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:22] kornilov: How many fulltime employed developers OB has?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:22] kornilov: very nice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:23] Rod: Have there been any updates for downloading offline messages quicker in the current client?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:23] Rod: I have done some prototypes for putting together OB features in the browser and the amount of time it takes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:26] chris.troutner: Sorry about that. My connection is sketchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:26] Rod: I did some testing with doing full IPNS crawl on a shorter interval and did not see any significant increase in resources used. Do you know if there is a specific reason the crawl speed is at the current speed it is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:26] Rod: I can follow up on slack later if needed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:27] chris.troutner: I just wanted to say congrats on the Hacktoberfest results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:28] Rod: Alright thank you Chris&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:28] chris.troutner: If OB wants to investigate BCH token integration (Wormhole or SLP), perhaps we could use it as an opportunity to incentivize community developers through swag and bounties, like gitcash.io or Gitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This is a video recording of the OpenBazaar Developer call on November 8, 2018.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How Will The BCH Hard Fork Affect OpenBazaar?</title><link href="https://openbazaar.org/blog/how-will-the-bch-hard-fork-on-nov-15-affect-openbazaar/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How Will The &lt;span class='post-title-extra'&gt;BCH Hard Fork&lt;/span&gt; Affect OpenBazaar?" /><published>2018-11-12T09:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-11-12T09:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://openbazaar.org/blog/how-will-the-bch-hard-fork-on-nov-15-affect-openbazaar</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://openbazaar.org/blog/how-will-the-bch-hard-fork-on-nov-15-affect-openbazaar/">&lt;h4 id=&quot;whats-happening-with-bitcoin-cash&quot;&gt;What’s Happening with Bitcoin Cash?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bitcoincash.org/&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Cash&lt;/a&gt; network upgrade beginning at 4:40PM UTC on November 15th, 2018. Depending on how the upgrade is accepted by the network, the Bitcoin Cash blockchain could fork into two or more incompatible chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that transacting is dangerous during a hard fork like this unless it’s between addresses you entirely control. If you transact BCH to an address you don’t control you could lose access to your coins on other forks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to help OpenBazaar users prepare for the hard fork, here is some information about the OpenBazaar wallet that can help you decide how to handle any BCH you may have stored there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-will-the-bitcoin-cash-upgrade-affect-my-openbazaar-funds&quot;&gt;How Will The Bitcoin Cash Upgrade Affect My OpenBazaar Funds?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users of &lt;strong&gt;OpenBazaar 2.2.5 and prior&lt;/strong&gt; who have an active BCH wallet are using a local SPV-based wallet. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/simplified-payment-verification&quot;&gt;SPV wallets&lt;/a&gt; are designed to follow the chain that has the most cumulative proof-of-work according to the existing Bitcoin Cash difficulty rules. The SPV wallet in OpenBazaar will follow the longest chain served by the peers it’s able to connect to. We advise that you withdraw your BCH from your OpenBazaar wallet until the chains settle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;withdraw-your-bch-to-electron&quot;&gt;Withdraw Your BCH to Electron&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Users of an OpenBazaar wallet control their funds by having sole access to their keys. The wallet maintains its keys and seed locally on your computer which you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002892791-How-do-I-backup-my-OpenBazaar-wallet-&quot;&gt;backup to a safe location using these steps&lt;/a&gt;. Then, import your seed into a &lt;strong&gt;BIP39-compatible wallet&lt;/strong&gt; (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://electroncash.org/&quot;&gt;Electron Cash&lt;/a&gt; ) to keep your funds safe through the fork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ob1.io&quot;&gt;OB1&lt;/a&gt; team will continue to observe the network upgrade and will take further actions as necessary to ensure the safety of our users’ funds at rest within the OpenBazaar wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-should-i-do-next&quot;&gt;What Should I Do Next?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next few weeks, make sure you have the keys to your OpenBazaar wallet stored somewhere safe as complications may arise. When things settle it is entirely your choice what you do with your coins, but we also recommend being cautious of a chain with hash power of 50% or more controlled by one entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The years leading up to &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/openbazaar-20-is-live/&quot;&gt;OpenBazaar 2.0&lt;/a&gt; went by in a flash, it seems, culminating in our best and most capable software release ever this month last year. Since then it’s been a whirlwind of development milestones, bug fixes, crypto political drama, and flying all over the world to promote the benefits of private, free trade for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;OpenBazaar_2_Turns_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar 2 Turns 1&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar 2 Turns 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Over 100,000 users have experienced the power of &lt;strong&gt;OpenBazaar 2.0&lt;/strong&gt; since it launched and it keeps growing bigger and stronger. All of our hard work continues to drive us collectively toward a better future for crypto users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-road-to-here&quot;&gt;The Road to Here&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We knew we were onto something great with version 1.0 of OpenBazaar. We used exciting, emerging technologies to build it but we discovered limits we wanted to push past to get the experience right for our users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development of OpenBazaar 2.0 started many months before its release late last year and took many hours of planning and designing from a large group of team members covering visual design, technical architecture, UX and UI development, community evangelism and marketing strategy.  Some critical decisions were made to improve the experience of OpenBazaar, like &lt;strong&gt;scrapping our fully decentralized search feature&lt;/strong&gt; in favor of using &lt;strong&gt;third party search engines&lt;/strong&gt; (much like how Bittorrent operates), and replacing our shoddy p2p protocol with Protocol Labs’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipfs.io/&quot;&gt;IPFS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://libp2p.io/&quot;&gt;libp2p&lt;/a&gt;. This made our network connectivity improve greatly (though we still have a lot of work to do) and laid the groundwork for getting us to &lt;strong&gt;mobile&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;web&lt;/strong&gt; applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bitcoin-breakdown&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Breakdown&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes took a long time to implement and deliver, but the team did so fairly seamlessly &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/openbazaar-20-is-live/&quot;&gt;on November 1st, 2017&lt;/a&gt;. There wasn’t much time to celebrate though as a transaction fee crisis was happening in parallel with a massive uptick in interest in Bitcoin. This sent the team into disarray as we struggled to find users who wanted to pay $30 in fees just to buy something like a $20 t-shirt in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some consternation we decided the only solution was to expand our payment options to include other currencies to ease the scalability pains felt by our users and so in &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/openbazaar-2-1-released-bitcoin-cash-and-zcash-integrated/&quot;&gt;January&lt;/a&gt; we released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bitcoincash.org/&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Cash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://z.cash&quot;&gt;ZCash (Beta)&lt;/a&gt; support for OpenBazaar. We are proud that we’ve been able to bring OpenBazaar to a broader community of crypto enthusiasts and are continuing that work today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wonder-whats-next&quot;&gt;Wonder What’s Next?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018 the breadth of crypto projects has increased exponentially through ERC-20 token issuances, completely new blockchains, layer two networks and more. We understand that there is a growing number of people interested in using all kinds of cryptocurrencies — not just Bitcoin — for e-commerce, coin trading, rewarding others for content creation and other use cases. OpenBazaar was always designed as a project for &lt;em&gt;the world&lt;/em&gt;, not just for Bitcoin, and we’re hard at work re-engineering it to support new coins and communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next release will center on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/Freedom-To-Trade-Means-Freedom-To-Choose-Currencies-The-OpenBazaar-Multiwallet/&quot;&gt;multiwallet&lt;/a&gt; which will allow users to send and receive payments from one wallet instance that can hold these five coins: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Zcash, Ethereum and Litecoin. We hope to introduce this new capability soon, followed by even more coins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;openbazaar-multiwallet-design.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Multiwallet design&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar Multiwallet design for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Zcash, Ethereum and Litecoin&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OB1 is also bringing OpenBazaar to mobile with &lt;strong&gt;our own iOS and Android apps&lt;/strong&gt;. We’re pioneering the technology to make a truly decentralized web version of OpenBazaar so that anyone can run it in their own standard browser. It’s an extremely bright future and every day thousands of new people are learning about the power of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other crypto projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are even more exciting developments on the horizon beyond these ambitious releases that I can’t wait to share with you. Please sign up for our &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/newsletter/&quot;&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to learn about them as they are announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month we are celebrating one year since the release of OpenBazaar 2.0 with promotions and events all month long. Connect with us on &lt;a href=&quot;https://reddit.com/r/openbazaar&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com/openbazaarproject&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/slack&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; to learn more and follow along on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/openbazaar&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; with the hashtag &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&amp;amp;q=%23OB2Turns1&quot;&gt;#OB2Turns1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day we use technologies that make our lives easier, but at the expense of our &lt;strong&gt;privacy&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;security&lt;/strong&gt;. We’re working on this freedom-focused project to give individuals another choice for how they buy, sell and share their information online, one that respects these values we share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This movement is about taking control of the future we want to see for ourselves and our neighbors all around the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited to keep working with you on this project and to help it grow together. We can only do it with your support so please spread the word and help us make OpenBazaar even better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">by Brian Hoffman, CEO, OB1</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why We Are Integrating Ethereum into OpenBazaar</title><link href="https://openbazaar.org/blog/why-we-are-integrating-ethereum-into-openbazaar/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why We Are Integrating &lt;span class='post-title-extra'&gt;Ethereum&lt;/span&gt; into OpenBazaar" /><published>2018-10-31T14:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-10-31T14:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://openbazaar.org/blog/why-we-are-integrating-ethereum-into-openbazaar</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://openbazaar.org/blog/why-we-are-integrating-ethereum-into-openbazaar/">&lt;p&gt;In a previous article we explained &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/Escrow-Smart-Contract-Specification-in-OpenBazaar/&quot;&gt;how we’re integrating Ethereum into OpenBazaar&lt;/a&gt; in addition to Bitcoin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bitcoincash.org/&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Cash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://z.cash/&quot;&gt;Zcash&lt;/a&gt;. In this article we want to talk about &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we’re integrating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ethereum.org/&quot;&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bitcoin-beginnings&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Beginnings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenBazaar began as a Bitcoin-only project, with the intent of creating an open, permissionless marketplace with no fees and no middlemen. From the beginning users wanted the ability to accept payments in cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin. While that was possible via our &lt;a href=&quot;https://shapeshift.io/&quot;&gt;Shapeshift&lt;/a&gt; integration, such payments weren’t really trustless. Non-bitcoin payments would just be Shapeshifted into bitcoin payments. Users effectively had to use Shapeshift as a middleman, had to trust them not to steal their funds, and had to pay them for the privilege. In that sense, non-bitcoin payments weren’t really &lt;em&gt;native&lt;/em&gt; to OpenBazaar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, in late 2017, bitcoin transaction fees began to rise. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.htm&quot;&gt;A lot&lt;/a&gt;. Using bitcoin for payments on OpenBazaar became impractical for months. Since payments in non-bitcoin currencies weren’t native on OpenBazaar (they were simply Shapefshifted into bitcoin payments) that meant &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; payments on OpenBazaar were impractical. Users wanted to use alternative currencies, but we were – effectively – forcing them to use bitcoin. Use of the platform ground to a halt. It was obvious something needed to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;becoming-crypto-inclusive&quot;&gt;Becoming Crypto-Inclusive&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want users to be able to trade using &lt;strong&gt;any cryptocurrency they desire&lt;/strong&gt;, without exposure to risks caused by other chains. In early 2018, in response to urgent demand from our users, we began integrating native altcoin payments into OpenBazaar. We’re refactoring our codebase to make it much easier to integrate new cryptocurrencies natively. The low hanging fruits are coins that are forks of Bitcoin, as their codebases are closest to what OpenBazaar was already supporting. Bitcoin Cash and Zcash were the first such integrations, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://litecoin.org/&quot;&gt;Litecoin&lt;/a&gt; integration is almost complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;enter-ethereum&quot;&gt;Enter Ethereum&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A natural continuation of that effort is to integrate Ethereum. Since Ethereum doesn’t share Bitcoin’s codebase, it has been more challenging to integrate than forks of Bitcoin. But we think it’s worth the effort because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ethereum has the largest community outside of Bitcoin.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Developer activity on Ethereum is huge and enthusiastic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The community has a special eagerness for its coin and tokens to be used for real-world commerce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating &lt;strong&gt;ETH&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;ERC20 payments&lt;/strong&gt; is a natural next-step for OpenBazaar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond simple payments, &lt;strong&gt;smart contracts&lt;/strong&gt; built on Ethereum – with its rich Turing-complete scripting language – may allow us to support markets that would be extremely challenging to support with Bitcoin-like script-based cryptocurrencies. Trustless auctions, DAO-based stores, insurance contracts, and affiliate marketing are just a few of the ideas we are exploring. Integrating Ethereum has the potential to expand the types of products and services offered on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users won’t be required to use Ethereum to use OpenBazaar, and can still stick to paying and being paid in Bitcoin or other supported cryptocurrencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;in-summary&quot;&gt;In Summary&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the landscape isn’t what it was when OpenBazaar first started. There is a rich ecosystem we cannot afford to ignore, and Ethereum is a huge part of that. We’re excited about implementing ETH and ERC20 payments, and are looking forward to working with the Ethereum community as we explore how we can leverage smart contracts in OpenBazaar.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In a previous article we explained how we’re integrating Ethereum into OpenBazaar in addition to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Zcash.

&lt;p&gt;The integration of Ethereum into OpenBazaar represents one of the most challenging and rewarding tasks we’ve done for the project so far. We are so excited to bring our vision of seeing cryptocurrency and tokens used for real-world commerce to the Ethereum community!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org&quot;&gt;OpenBazaar&lt;/a&gt; facilitates trades between arbitrary third parties on the internet. Currently, only UTXO-based cryptocurrencies can be used as a medium of exchange on OpenBazaar. The escrow contract is intended to be used as a way to shoehorn Ethereum functionality into OpenBazaar’s existing framework so that users can trade using ETH and ERC20 tokens as their medium of exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-openbazaar-trades-currently-work-in-utxo-land&quot;&gt;How OpenBazaar Trades Currently Work (in UTXO land)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;moderated-payments&quot;&gt;Moderated Payments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a buyer and seller have agreed on a product and a price, the buyer sends their funds to an escrow address, which is a 2-of-3 multisig address with one key controlled by the buyer, one key controlled by the seller, and one key controlled by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/how-to-choose-a-good-moderator-on-openbazaar&quot;&gt;moderator&lt;/a&gt; that has been agreed upon by both the buyer and the seller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the “happy path”, the seller delivers the goods, then the buyer releases the funds to the seller (with the buyer and seller signing the payout transaction from the escrow address).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event that the seller does not deliver the goods as promised, the buyer pleads their case to the moderator, and the buyer &amp;amp; moderator can send the funds from escrow back to the buyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the (very common) case where the buyer receives their goods but doesn’t release the funds to the seller, the seller presents their case to the moderator, and the seller &amp;amp; moderator sign the funds from escrow to the seller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seller can also unilaterally release funds from escrow after a previously agreed upon amount of time has passed. This allows the seller to release the funds from escrow without the moderator in the event that the buyer disappears. With UTXO-based coins, this is achieved by requiring that the buyer sign an nLockTime transaction releasing funds to the seller, and then passing that transaction to the seller (off-chain) before the seller delivers the product or service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;direct-payments&quot;&gt;Direct Payments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buyers have the option of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; using a moderator when making an OpenBazaar trade. While this isn’t recommended, it may be an acceptable risk for the buyer if the buyer trusts the seller. Direct or unmoderated payments come in two forms: online payments and offline payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online direct payments&lt;/strong&gt; occur when the buyer knows the seller is online. For online payments, the buyer simply sends the funds directly to the seller’s wallet after requesting an address to pay to. These are simple, classic transfers of value from one account to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offline payments&lt;/strong&gt; occur when the buyer sees that the seller is offline and is &lt;em&gt;uncertain&lt;/em&gt; whether the seller will ever come back online. In this case the buyer sends the funds to a 1-of-2 multisig address with one key held by the buyer and the other held by the seller. If the seller comes back online, they can accept the funds. If the seller doesn’t come back online, the buyer can reclaim the funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations Imposed by OpenBazaar’s Wallet Interface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenBazaar interacts with all supported coins through its &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenBazaar/wallet-interface/blob/master/wallet.go#L77&quot;&gt;wallet interface&lt;/a&gt;. This means that OpenBazaar’s Ethereum smart contracts must be designed in such a way as to be compatible with that interface. OpenBazaar is a live/launched product, so making big changes to the wallet interface in order to support Ethereum is non-trivial. Instead, we’ve decided to keep the wallet interface fixed (for now), and design the smart contract to be compatible with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intended-use-of-the-escrow-contract&quot;&gt;Intended Use of the Escrow contract&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Escrow contract will store the escrowed funds and state information for &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; OpenBazaar trade that is using Ethereum (or ERC20 tokens) as the medium of exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could have, instead, opted to deploy a new escrow contract for each Ethereum-based trade — thereby siloing escrowed funds from each trade in their own smart contract. However, we think the gas requirements for doing so are cost prohibitive, and we fear that would introduce too much friction into Ethereum-based trades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenBazaar trades that use ETH/ERC20 as the medium of exchange are intended to follow the same protocol as those that use a UTXO-based coin as the medium of exchange — and the escrow smart contract is intended to facilitate that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;funding-the-trade&quot;&gt;Funding the Trade&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buyers initiate a trade by creating/storing a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Transaction&lt;/code&gt; struct in the Escrow contract and (simultaneously) funding the transaction by sending ETH (or ERC20 tokens) to the Escrow contract. At this point the transaction is in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FUNDED&lt;/code&gt; state. While in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FUNDED&lt;/code&gt; state, the buyer may add more ETH (or ERC20 tokens) to escrow if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;releasing-funds-from-escrow&quot;&gt;Releasing Funds from Escrow&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the transaction is in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FUNDED&lt;/code&gt; state, the escrowed funds can be released only if:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two of the three participants (buyer, seller, and moderator) agree on how the escrowed funds are to be distributed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An amount of time (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;timeoutHourse&lt;/code&gt;) has passed since the last time the buyer added funds to escrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasoning behind (2) is that it is very common for buyers to not release funds after they’ve received their goods (this is due more to buyer laziness than malice). In that event, we want to make it easy for the seller to claim the escrowed funds without having to coordinate with a moderator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funds released from escrow can be split up and sent to various addresses. However, the receiving addresses &lt;em&gt;must be&lt;/em&gt; the addresses of the trade’s buyer, seller, or moderator. To reiterate, funds cannot be sent to an address that is not affiliated with the trade in question, but the escrowed funds can be divided up among the participants in any way — so long as 2-of-3 of the parties agree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon release of funds from escrow, the trade is put into the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RELEASED&lt;/code&gt; state. Once in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RELEASED&lt;/code&gt; state, trades can no longer be altered. All participants who received some of the escrowed funds are noted in the trade’s Transaction struct (via the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beneficiaries&lt;/code&gt; mapping).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beneficiaries&lt;/code&gt; information will be used later, by other contracts, to determine whether or not a given trade was disputed, refunded, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;offline-direct-payments&quot;&gt;Offline Direct Payments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The escrow contract can mirror the behavior of UTXO-based offline payments by calling &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;addTransaction&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;addTokenTransaction&lt;/code&gt; if it is an ERC20 transaction), setting the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;threshold&lt;/code&gt; value to 1, and setting the moderator address to a known, non-zero burn address. The effect is the equivalent of a 1-of-2 multisig address where the buyer holds one key and the seller holds the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;known-issues--misc&quot;&gt;Known Issues / Misc&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;moderator-selection&quot;&gt;Moderator selection&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is assumed that the moderator is &lt;em&gt;trusted&lt;/em&gt; by both the buyer and the seller before the trade begins. The obvious threat of collusion between a buyer and moderator — or seller and moderator — is beyond the scope of this contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;push-vs-pull&quot;&gt;Push vs pull&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;transferFunds&lt;/code&gt; function uses push payments (rather than the pull model) due to limitations imposed by OpenBazaar’s wallet interface. Hence any of the beneficiaries of a payout from escrow can cause the payout to fail (for example, by putting a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;revert()&lt;/code&gt; in their fallback function).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game theoretically speaking, such a DoS attack is irrational for any of the participants capable of causing such an issue, because the honest parties can always benefit by removing the offending party as a beneficiary and taking her share of the payout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose the three parties agreed that the moderator would received 5% of the funds, and that the buyer and seller would split the remaining funds. The seller, being unhappy with the result, could cause the payout to fail until she could negotiate a more favorable agreement. However, the buyer &amp;amp; moderator — upon seeing the seller’s misbehavior — could simply agree to remove the seller as a beneficiary — thus removing the seller’s ability to DoS the payout.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, we consider the DoS possibility caused by use of push payments in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;transferFunds&lt;/code&gt; function to be low risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;quality-assurance&quot;&gt;Quality assurance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code for the escrow smart contract can be found in Github &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenBazaar/smart-contracts/blob/master/contracts/escrow/Escrow_v1_0.sol&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We invite the community to examine the code and post issues or suggestions. Furthermore, we have written 37 tests for the contract to achieve &amp;gt;90% code coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;audit&quot;&gt;Audit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://openzeppelin.org/&quot;&gt;OpenZeppelin&lt;/a&gt; to have the contracts audited and hope to have the audit process completed before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
