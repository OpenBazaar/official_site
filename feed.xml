We support events that bring together people from all around the world to encourage them to create and we’re excited about participating in &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details&quot;&gt;Hacktoberfest&lt;/a&gt; this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the month of October people around the world are working to motivate each other to contribute to open source projects. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details&quot;&gt;register your Github account&lt;/a&gt; and commit at least five pull requests to any public project hosted on Github to earn your own limited edition tee commemorating your participation. &lt;strong&gt;Hacktoberfest ends October 31st&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OB1 has &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-go/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahacktoberfest&quot;&gt;curated a few issues&lt;/a&gt; for OpenBazaar and will be adding more throughout the month. This is an ideal time for new developers to get involved in OpenBazaar and become familiar with the codebase. Don’t wait long! Some of these issues have been snatched up already, and we’re already more than halfway through October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are other ways to contribute to OpenBazaar, including:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Offering &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.transifex.com/ob1/openbazaar/&quot;&gt;translations&lt;/a&gt; for one of our 63 supported languages or translate a new language&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assisting with code documentation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/meet&quot;&gt;a brand ambassador at a local meetup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

(Or Bitcoin Cash, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://z.cash/&quot;&gt;Zcash&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of things on OpenBazaar! It is a marketplace where you can buy and sell what you want and connect to people all around the world who are using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are 3 great stores for you to shop at today:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;casa-store&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com/store/Qmd9hFFuueFrSR7YwUuAfirXXJ7ANZAMc5sx4HFxn7mPkc&quot;&gt;Casa Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Casa_Store_on_OpenBazaar.png&quot; alt=&quot;Casa Store on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Casa Store on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com/store/Qmd9hFFuueFrSR7YwUuAfirXXJ7ANZAMc5sx4HFxn7mPkc&quot;&gt;Casa Store on OpenBazaar&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Casa began as a personal key management system then expanded to help their customers with hardware solutions as well. They are an Authorized Reseller for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ledger.com/&quot;&gt;Ledger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://trezor.io/&quot;&gt;Trezor&lt;/a&gt; and in September this year they expanded again. They began pre-releases for their brand new &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com/store/Qmd9hFFuueFrSR7YwUuAfirXXJ7ANZAMc5sx4HFxn7mPkc/casa-lightning-node&quot;&gt;Lightning Nodes&lt;/a&gt; and sold out the first two shipment waves in the first day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;em&gt;lucky you&lt;/em&gt;, it does seem that December shipments are still available on OpenBazaar…
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;crypto-greeting-cards&quot;&gt;Crypto Greeting Cards&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Crypto_Greeting_Cards_on_OpenBazaar.png&quot; alt=&quot;Crypto Greeting Cards on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Crypto Greeting Cards on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com/store/QmbmytVomWgsBW74QgyPdh17adoPBJeo2g7scihNPAjMmy&quot;&gt;Crypto Greeting Cards on OpenBazaar&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you are seeking high-quality, cryptocurrency-themed greeting cards for your fellow crypto-enthusiasts, they’ve got you covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want greeting cards that allow you to easily give the gift of cryptocurrency along with practical educational materials, they’ve &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; got you covered!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what they say about their store:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“After being tired of the stacks of mundane, generic store-brand greeting cards, we set out to pair our passion in cryptocurrency with designs inspired by the community. Each card features a pre-generated cryptocurrency wallet that can be transferred to the recipient. Like cash in an envelope, only better. The goal is to inspire new participants to join the financial revolution!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crypto Greeting Cards are an affordable way to introduce friends, family, and loved ones to cryptocurrency. After redeeming the card, the recipient will learn:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to set up a wallet app&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The difference between public address and private key&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;An introduction to transactions (sweeping funds)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is there any better way to spread cryptocurrency than kind words and a small gift?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think not.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;crypto-republic---bch&quot;&gt;Crypto Republic - BCH&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Spend your Bitcoin Cash on some great items from apparel to video games at Crypto Republic. They have a lot of great information about who they are and what they stand for and how to get around OpenBazaar on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com/store/home/QmU5ZSKVz2GhsqE6EmBGVCtrui4YhUXny6rbvsSf5h2xvH&quot;&gt;About page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

You’ll learn how to buy cryptocurrency with a different cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin. At the moment OpenBazaar doesn’t support people buying cryptocurrency with regular fiat money such as US Dollars or Euros, though it’s a feature that will hopefully be supported in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a video tutorial explaining the process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mb-5&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe class=&quot;embed-responsive-item&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/q6ki3_1Io-U&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-download-openbazaar&quot;&gt;Step #1: Download OpenBazaar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/download&quot;&gt;OpenBazaar.org&lt;/a&gt; and click on the installer link for your operating system. Once the installer file is downloaded, open the file and it will begin the process of installing OpenBazaar.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-select-cryptocurrency&quot;&gt;Step #2: Select cryptocurrency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be asked which cryptocurrency you want to use. This is the cryptocurrency that you will pay with as a buyer, or receive as a seller. This is not the currency that you wish to purchase.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;selectingcurrency.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Select Purchasing Cryptocurrency&quot; title=&quot;Select Purchasing Cryptocurrency&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
At the moment OpenBazaar users are limited to using only one cryptocurrency at a time, and can only choose BTC, BCH, or ZEC. However in the near future users will be able to use multiple currencies at the same time, and will have LTC, ETH, and other coins available to use.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-complete-onboarding&quot;&gt;Step #3: Complete Onboarding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go through the onboarding process and enter whatever information you choose. If you want to remain private then keep the randomly generated name assigned to you. Choose the currency you want to have prices displayed in; you’ll want this to be the currency that you most commonly use so that the prices of goods and services are familiar to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the terms of service, and if you agree then accept them.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;onboarding.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Complete Onboarding&quot; title=&quot;Complete Onboarding&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-4-search-for-cryptocurrency-listings&quot;&gt;Step #4: Search for cryptocurrency listings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re now up and running on OpenBazaar, so let’s find some cryptocurrency listings. Click the “Discover” button on the top right of the client (the blue tent). After selecting a search provider, you’ll now see lots of listings on the network. To filter down to only cryptocurrency offerings, use the search provider’s filters on the left. You’ll now see a list of cryptocurrencies for sale. Find what you want and click on the listing to view it.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;searchcurrency.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Search for Cryptocurrency&quot; title=&quot;Search for Cryptocurrency&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-5-buy-the-cryptocurrency&quot;&gt;Step #5: Buy the cryptocurrency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s recommended that you find a vendor who has a “Verified Moderator” on their listings. This means you will be able to choose escrow from a reputable third party. You can tell if they offer a verified moderator by looking for a little orange badge underneath the seller’s name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve found some crypto you want to buy, click the “Trade now” button to start the checkout process. You’ll need to enter a receiving address for the funds you’re buying. As in the example below, if you’re buying Decred then you’ll need to put in a Decred address that you control where the seller will send the cryptocurrency you buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then choose payment type. Unless you fully trust the vendor, you should use a moderated payment with a verified moderator. Enter the amount you wish to buy, then review your order and click “Pay.” You’ll now see the payment screen.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;examplepurchase.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Buy the Cryptocurrency&quot; title=&quot;Buy the Cryptocurrency&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-6-send-payment&quot;&gt;Step #6: Send Payment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve placed the order you now need to pay for it. There are two ways to pay in OpenBazaar. One is by scanning the QR code on a mobile wallet or copying the details on the payment screen into a separate wallet and sending payment. The other method is using the internal OpenBazaar wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t want to use a separate wallet, or you try using an external wallet and you receive an error message, then it’s best to use the internal OpenBazaar wallet and click the “Pay from Wallet” button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you can pay from the OpenBazaar wallet, you’ll need to fund it. To do this, click on the wallet button, then in the wallet interface click “Receive Money.” This will display a QR code and address you can use to fund the wallet. Note that you’ll need to wait for one confirmation on the blockchain before the funds are spendable.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;obwalletreceive.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Receive funds in OpenBazaar Wallet&quot; title=&quot;Receive funds in OpenBazaar Wallet&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To pay for orders you’ve already placed, click on “Purchases” in the dropdown menu on the top right (your profile picture) and then click on the specific order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once payment has been sent you’ll see a green check mark appear and it’s now up to the vendor to fulfill your order.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-7-check-your-order&quot;&gt;Step #7: Check your order&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check your order, click on “Purchases” in the dropdown menu on the top right (your profile picture) and then click on the specific order. You’ll see a bar showing the progress of the order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the seller fulfills the order you should see it showing “fulfilled,” and the vendor should send confirmation such as a transaction hash to prove they sent the funds to the address you provided. Enter the transaction hash into a block explorer to verify, or just check the wallet where you expected the funds to be sent. If you’ve received them, leave a review and close the order out. It’s important that you do finish the order, otherwise the funds will not be released from escrow and the seller will be forced to open a dispute to claim their funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t receive the funds in a reasonable period, message the seller to ask why. If you get no response after a while or something else is wrong with your order, you can choose to open a dispute with the moderator by clicking the “Dispute Order” button when viewing the order in your purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenBazaar is also a platform for goods and services. While you’re waiting for the vendor to send your new coins, check out what the marketplace has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you know how to purchase cryptocurrencies privately and with no fees using OpenBazaar.&lt;/p&gt;

What about when the price shoots up and we know how valuable it can be if we hodl it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s a broad definition of a currency:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Something (such as coins, treasury notes, and banknotes) that is in circulation as a medium of exchange.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A currency can be anything that multiple people agree has value and they’re willing to exchange for other things, such as goods or services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, how do you know that a t-shirt is worth $20? It’s because that’s a generally accepted market price, which leads to you and a specific vendor trading a shirt for $20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;do-cryptocurrencies-have-value-we-can-measure&quot;&gt;Do cryptocurrencies have value we can measure?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, cryptocurrencies that are traded on exchanges have value measured next to national currencies so you can track their value at any given time. They also have value on their own, but due to their newness most people make sense of cryptocurrency values in terms of other existing currencies. For now it’s still easier to understand what exchanging $20 for a t-shirt means rather than “0.0031 BTC.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit stores from around the world&lt;/strong&gt; where people just like you, who believe in the power of cryptocurrency, are working on their entrepreneurial hustle. Some people are selling on OpenBazaar because they don’t have access to other online marketplaces due to the cost of participating or restrictions based on their location. Some users are also on OpenBazaar because their products are very fringe or niche such as religious objects or political items. It’s exciting to see how a decentralized marketplace can connect all types of people!

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-protect-your-privacy-by-using-cryptocurrency&quot;&gt;3. Protect your privacy by using cryptocurrency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each time you buy something on a large e-commerce platform with a credit card you are forced to share your personal data with multiple companies, who then add this data into a profile they’ve built about you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While cryptocurrencies don’t offer complete privacy, they are more private than credit cards. By purchasing on a platform like OpenBazaar &lt;strong&gt;you never share personal data with a centralized platform&lt;/strong&gt;, only with the vendor you are purchasing a physical item from. If you purchase digital goods or services you aren’t forced to give any personal information at all.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-help-build-the-future-you-want-to-see&quot;&gt;4. Help build the future you want to see&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen ups and downs with the cryptocurrency market but we’re not in this because of the speculation frenzy. We’re in this because it is the ground floor of a huge technological revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crypto-commerce still has a way to go but we don’t get to the future we believe in by waiting—we get there by doing. The OpenBazaar development team believes this and built this decentralized marketplace specifically to utilize the special qualities of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line is we like cryptocurrency and we want to see it put to work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t you like to use money that lets you be in control of it? Money with values set by markets around the world, not exclusively by too-big-to-fail banks and questionable governments?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who are buying and selling on OpenBazaar &lt;strong&gt;believe in using cryptocurrencies AS currencies&lt;/strong&gt; to exchange for goods and services they need or want. If you believe this too, then OpenBazaar is a great place for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a &lt;em&gt;decentralized&lt;/em&gt; online marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenBazaar is like its own separate part of the internet. It’s a network of users who connect directly to one another instead of to centralized websites like Amazon or Ebay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decentralized architecture that makes it powerful can also make it a bit hard to understand at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ob1.io&quot;&gt;OB1&lt;/a&gt;, the team leading the development of OpenBazaar, has designed a few things that make it easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These items are add-ons and are &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-decentralization/&quot;&gt;less decentralized&lt;/a&gt; than the network itself. They make shopping easier but they do not change the decentralized protocol nor the privacy or security of your transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/decentralized-search-and-content-discovery-on-openbazaar/&quot;&gt;search engines&lt;/a&gt; within the application that help you discover items. OB1 created the first search engine but anyone is welcome to build one and make it available for others to add to their own OpenBazaar instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With OB1 search you can choose from a selection of suggested categories or search by shipping location, coin payment type, moderator type, or rating. You can also toggle adult filters on and off or search within different product types including physical goods, cryptocurrencies, digital goods, and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging technology that focuses on decentralizing the Internet is exciting, but still new. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/how-decentralized-application-development-nearly-destroyed-my-world/&quot;&gt;many challenges to overcome when building decentralized applications&lt;/a&gt; but we are optimistic about industry progress. Working through these challenges is a point of pride for the development team and we are excited to keep building a better and better user experience for OpenBazaar.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">OpenBazaar is not like a regular online marketplace.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">5 Tips To Make Your OpenBazaar Listings Pop</title><link href="https://openbazaar.org/blog/5-tips-to-make-your-openbazaar-listings-pop/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="&lt;span class='post-title-extra'&gt;5 Tips&lt;/span&gt; To Make Your OpenBazaar Listings &lt;span class='post-title-extra'&gt;Pop&lt;/span&gt;" /><published>2018-09-18T09:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-18T09:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://openbazaar.org/blog/5%20-tips-to-make-your-openbazaar-listings-pop</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://openbazaar.org/blog/5-tips-to-make-your-openbazaar-listings-pop/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Monique Boediono, OpenBazaar UX Designer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E-commerce is an exciting and flexible way to start your own business. With some e-commerce business models you can even earn money from the comfort of your own home. While there are many opportunities to get started, there are also many ways to get lost in the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;OpenBazaar Store on OpenBazaar.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Store on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar Store on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With OpenBazaar, the world’s largest decentralized marketplace, you can build your store and listings faster than on any other network. We have some tips that will help your store stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have something you’ve been itching to sell on OpenBazaar, here are 5 tips to help make your listings &lt;strong&gt;POP&lt;/strong&gt; on the network! 🎈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Creating Listing Tags on OpenBazaar.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Creating a Listing Title on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Creating a Listing Title on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-write-a-descriptive-title&quot;&gt;1. Write a descriptive title&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your title should give your buyers a clear idea of what you’re selling. When writing a title, try throwing in a few descriptive keywords to give your listing some extra oomph. For example, “hand-crafted pure copper jug with lid” is a lot more interesting and helpful than just “water jug”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-take-many-many-photos-&quot;&gt;2. Take many, many photos 📸&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a picture is worth a thousand words and you can attach up to 30 photos for every listing, that should save you 30,000 words (and way too many headaches), right? Take advantage of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photos are arguably the most important part of a listing – it’s the closest a buyer can come to seeing your product in person. Take clear, high-quality pictures in plenty of light to really let your product shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Simple Listing Image on OpenBazaar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Simple Listing Image on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Simple Listing Image on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;get-rid-of-background-clutter&quot;&gt;Get rid of background clutter&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t detract from the star of the show. Stage your product against a plain background. This removes distractions and allows your product to stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIP:&lt;/strong&gt; Can’t find a good plain surface anywhere? Textured surfaces can also work well. Place your product on marble counters and wooden coffee tables. Or, just hang up a bedsheet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;give-us-variety&quot;&gt;Give us variety&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show us how your product looks with different angles and settings. Snap some closeups to capture unique and intricate details. Showcase your product in action. If you’re selling a t-shirt, take photos of the shirt on a model so your buyers can see how much cooler it looks on a human being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to include photos of variants too! If you’re selling the same dress in red, white, and black, show us what each of them looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Dress Variations on OpenBazaar.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dress Variations on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Dress Variations on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;choose-your-primary-photo&quot;&gt;Choose your primary photo&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your primary photo is the first thing a buyer will see when they find your listing. It’s both the thumbnail image and the cover photo on your listing’s main page. You want to make a stellar first impression, so use your most captivating photo as your listing’s primary photo. To do this, click your chosen photo and drag it left to the the first spot in the list of pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Setting Your Primary Listing Photo on OpenBazaar.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Setting Your Primary Listing Photo on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Setting Your Primary Listing Photo on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, your primary photo should capture your product as a whole. So instead of a close-up detail shot, try to choose a photo that shows your product in full view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-give-us-the-deets-&quot;&gt;3. Give us the deets ☕&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details are key, so don’t skimp on product descriptions! Start with the basics first: what’s for sale?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Handmade red mini tassel earrings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vintage whiskey decanter set with matching glasses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Age Beets headphones: powered purely by organic beet juice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, go into more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;colour&quot;&gt;Colour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colours are deceivingly hard to convey through photos. How a shade looks can vary wildly depending on lighting, or the kind of device you’re using to view it. Give your buyers a more accurate understanding of an item’s colour by using more specific descriptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, instead of “red”, try:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vermillion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crimson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raspberry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Burgundy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Image from Ingrid Sundberg’s Colour Thesaurus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;size&quot;&gt;Size&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bust out the tape measure so you can let people know how big or small your item is. If you’re selling clothing, it’s helpful to include a size guide like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Example of a Size Guide on OpenBazaar.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of a Size Guide on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Example of a Size Guide on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;material&quot;&gt;Material&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s your product made of? Stainless steel, copper, wood, bamboo… If this lip balm features beeswax collected from your own personal backyard apiary, be sure to let your buyers know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-to-use&quot;&gt;How to use&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give us some instructions on how to use and care for your product. For example: Where should it be stored? Is it dishwasher safe or hand wash only? Can I toss it in the dryer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspire your buyers. Show them different ways to use your product. If you’re selling a scarf, offer a few examples for how they can wear and style that scarf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, you can also give them some ideas for how a product might fit into their lives –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Kindle would be a great gift for your neighborhood bookworm who may or may not have a hoarding problem!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does your cat take massive poops? Our double-duty clothespin doubles as a nostril clamp!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absolutely irresistible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-break-up-long-blocks-of-text&quot;&gt;4. Break up long blocks of text&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product descriptions or store policies can get lengthy. Don’t make your buyer slog through line after line of text. Instead, format your content to help them find the information they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;write-short-paragraphs&quot;&gt;Write short paragraphs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep your paragraphs to 3-5 lines max. If you have a lot to communicate, try organizing the content into sections with header titles. It will make the information much less intimidating and easier to digest. For example, in your product description, you can have sections for &lt;em&gt;key features&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;dimensions&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;care instructions&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;use-bullet-points&quot;&gt;Use bullet points&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullet points are your friends! They’re easy to read and convey a lot of information very quickly. Use them when you can. They’re especially helpful when listing product features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;format-your-text&quot;&gt;Format your text&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little text formatting can go a long way. Call out important tidbits in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt; so they don’t get lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;add-visuals&quot;&gt;Add visuals&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get creative! Break up your text with photos and GIFs. Visuals can add an instant POP to your content, making it dynamic and engaging. For example, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com/store/QmU5ZSKVz2GhsqE6EmBGVCtrui4YhUXny6rbvsSf5h2xvH/mini-metro-cd-key-steam&quot;&gt;this listing by Crypto Republic - BCH&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; OpenBazaar doesn’t store images that you can include in the description. You need to store them somewhere else on the internet and use their URL to add them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-add-tags-to-get-your-listing-discovered&quot;&gt;5. Add &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/how-to-get-more-buyers-on-openbazaar-with-categories-and-tags&quot;&gt;tags&lt;/a&gt; to get your listing discovered!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Creating Listing Tags on OpenBazaar.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Creating Listing Tags on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Creating Listing Tags on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, make sure you tag your products so people can find them on the network. You’ve put a lot of blood and sweat into creating this listing, so you deserve to get some eyeballs on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When tagging your listing, try to think like a shopper – if you were looking for a product like this, what kind of search terms would you use? Some questions you can ask yourself include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-would-a-shopper-describe-this-item&quot;&gt;How would a shopper describe this item?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if I were looking for a pair of green earrings, I might search:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jewelery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earrings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Studs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Green&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emerald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-would-a-shopper-be-looking-for-this-item&quot;&gt;Why would a shopper be looking for this item?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a shopper, I might not know exactly what I’m looking for. I could be shopping for a gift for my mom. In that case, I might search:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gifts for her&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mother’s day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chat log:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:57] Sameep: how many mikes are there??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:58] mg (OB1): Not enough!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:04] chris.troutner: The mobile app has not been release yet, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:05] mg (OB1): No it hasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:07] chris.troutner: Who has been leading the charge on understanding the code that makes up an Insight server? I’d like to pick their brain offline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:12] chris.troutner: That’s exciting. Thanks for the clarification, Josh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:15] Moonshot: Did you consider having a server work for multiple users? Something that would allow the full server functionality to read the user data stored locally. Is that what the relay node is meant to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:16] Moonshot: Ok thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:20] chris.troutner: @mg please keep me in the loop with that Insight testing stuff. Bitcoin.com might be able to help pool resources with OB&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:21] mg (OB1): I’m not sure what pooled resources you had in mind, but we’re open to any ideas you had on that. I imagine the blog post that gets produced will have a lot of details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:24] Rod: Speaking of Bitcoin Cash, what are some of the main barriers to getting the multi-currency support setup right now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:26] mg (OB1): Do you mean multiple currencies simultaneously?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:27] Rod: I am talking about being able to accept multiple currencies through an individual listing right now instead of setting up separate listings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:29] chris.troutner: Do you guys know if there will be any blowback from Shapeshifts recent announcement about accounts? Will it impact the ability to pay using Shapeshift in OB?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:31] Moonshot: Does that mean the wallets for each coin need to be trusted, since you are not going to be running SPV for each one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:34] Moonshot: If performance is the obstacle to SPV, did you consider running SPV for all coins and limiting the # of wallets a user can run simultaneously?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:35] chris.troutner: Running for SPV for all coins is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:38] chris.troutner: Thanks for the clarification, Sam. I hadn’t really used it. Was just curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:39] art: Any news on Monero integration?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:41] art: Cool, thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:41] art: If one wanted to use OB for services, is there a tutorial?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:42] chris.troutner: Tutorials:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:43] art: Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:44] chris.troutner: Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:44] roka: thanks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[11:44] Jenn_OB1: Thanks everyone!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This is a video recording of the OpenBazaar Developer call on September 13, 2018.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How Decentralized Application Development Nearly Destroyed My World</title><link href="https://openbazaar.org/blog/how-decentralized-application-development-nearly-destroyed-my-world/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How &lt;span class='post-title-extra'&gt;Decentralized Application Development&lt;/span&gt; Nearly &lt;span class='post-title-extra'&gt;Destroyed My World&lt;/span&gt;" /><published>2018-09-13T11:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-13T11:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://openbazaar.org/blog/how-decentralized-application-development-nearly-destroyed-my-world</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://openbazaar.org/blog/how-decentralized-application-development-nearly-destroyed-my-world/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Rob Misiorowski, OpenBazaar Front End Developer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, that title is a little hyperbolic, but decentralized applications with modern user experiences are few and far between and present some unique challenges for front-end developers. In this post I’ll describe some of these challenges and give examples of how we addressed them when developing the OpenBazaar desktop client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fundamentally-different-paradigms&quot;&gt;Fundamentally Different Paradigms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;strong&gt;centralized application&lt;/strong&gt;, the data is primarily stored in and retrieved from one central source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, an app has 10,000 thing-a-magoos and they are all stored on a central server that’s administered by professional engineers and has professional quality hardware and software behind it. It’s optimized to process large numbers of client requests for data in a highly streamlined way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is useful when you need to retrieve and organize many pieces of data, like on a webpage that displays the top 50 thing-a-magoos on the network. With a centralized server, a client can efficiently retrieve the data it needs for all 50 thing-a-magoos in one single call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now, let’s consider a similar app, but one that is &lt;strong&gt;decentralized&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data doesn’t live in one central location. Each user stores their own data and distributes it to other peers on the network as those peers view the data. Instead of highly optimized hardware, this is a blend of computers ranging from Joe’s 8 year old desktop PC to Jennie’s brand new macbook pro. While some of these may be high end, it’s doubtful that most of these users will have production server level hardware or software. Now, instead of retrieving data from one central location, you likely have to go through all types of home routers and firewalls to get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back to our landing page example from above, instead of making a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; call to retrieve data for 50 thing-a-magoos, now we need to make &lt;em&gt;50 calls&lt;/em&gt; (one to each user) to retrieve the data. Actually, it will almost certainly be many multiple multiples of 50, since P2P libraries like &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipfs.io&quot;&gt;IPFS&lt;/a&gt; will retrieve the same pieces of data from multiple nodes to compare for authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-challenges-does-this-cause&quot;&gt;What Challenges Does This Cause?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hopefully getting clearer why there is much more leg-work involved in retrieving data in a decentralized way, but what challenges does this pose for clients?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Latency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speed difference is significant between retrieving a single piece of data from a highly optimized production server verses from the home computer of the average person. For example, in the centralized world, if the average server request takes more than a fraction of a second to return—let’s say 250ms—it would often be considered slow and teams of engineers would be having meetings on how to reduce this. In our desktop client, we routinely have requests taking upwards of a minute before possibly timing out. And that’s just for a single request. I’m sure you can imagine the difference between retrieving a list of 50 thing-a-magoos in one request from a central server versus having to make a call for each one across a network of distributed nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequent data retrieval errors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a popular centralized app like Facebook. How often do you enter a legitimate url and have some type of error return? I would venture to say hardly ever. In a decentralized app this world is destroyed because quite regularly calls for data fail. Perhaps the user isn’t online, nor are any seeders of the data? Perhaps some are online, but are unreachable? Perhaps you’re even making a call for a piece of data that no longer exists (e.g. a deleted listing)? Further complicating the issue is that we often don’t know the root cause of the failure. The error message could basically just be a large “shrug” emoji.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Shrug_Emoji.png&quot; alt=&quot;Shrug Emoji&quot; title=&quot;Shrug Emoji&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Browsers live in a centralized world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OpenBazaar front end is developed with Electron, which uses Chromium, the tech behind the Google Chrome browser. As such, it’s subject to many of the browser’s restrictions. One of those is that you are limited to 6 concurrent requests to the same domain. Even though we’re ultimately getting the data from many nodes, the requests are proxied through each node’s server. In other words, from the browser’s point of view, a fetch of 20 different user profiles are all coming from the same domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If latency weren’t an issue this wouldn’t be so bad. Even if a request took a less than ideal 250ms, you would be able to fully display a grid of 24 users in one second. But when requests routinely take 30 seconds, 45 seconds or 1 minute plus, suddenly it takes a whole lot of time to fully display a page. Even more problematic is that your request queue can clog up. Let’s say one profile comes back in a lightning fast 100ms and we display a user box for that user with a Follow button. If there are still 23 pending requests, even if the user clicks that Follow button, it will be put at the end of the queue and not even be called until all but 5 requests remain, which may easily be a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;an-example-of-how-we-addressed-these-challenges&quot;&gt;An Example of How We Addressed These Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenBazaar has an integrated chat section that’s really an app within an app. The chat app is present from the time your server starts and remains perpetually in the sidebar. Initially, this was a world destroyer because the little &lt;strong&gt;chat heads&lt;/strong&gt; (the user icons you click to open a conversation with a user) require some profile data from the party you’re conversing with (e.g. avatar, name). If a user is even slightly chatty and has engaged in at least 6 conversations, then those 6 profile calls would be enough to clog up the request queue and potentially prevent critical app functionality from being available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Chat Heads in OpenBazaar.png&quot; alt=&quot;Chat Heads in OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Chat Heads in OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;heres-how-we-handled-some-of-the-challenges-decentralization-presented-us-in-openbazaar-chat&quot;&gt;Here’s how we handled some of the challenges decentralization presented us in OpenBazaar chat:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Latency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The server stores a list of your conversations. Within that data set is the peer ID of each person you are chatting with and the last message in the conversation. This allows us to create a chat head with a default avatar and use the peer ID as the name. The peer ID is also enough to make a link to the user’s page. While it may take up to a minute for the user’s avatar and name show up, at least you’ll have something showing in the client and you won’t be prevented from starting the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we implement multiple layers of caching. We can’t do this for all requests because for some it’s important you have fresh data. In this case, however, the user’s name and avatar will likely not change that often and if you do see data that is a few minutes (or occasionally a few days) old, it doesn’t degrade your experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One level of caching is done on the server where it will store the user’s profile on disk. Then, when you make a call and indicate a cached response is acceptable, the server will immediately send back the cached version and behind-the-scenes make an IPFS query to update the cache. In theory, the cached version will never be more than one revision behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other layer of cache is an in-memory client cache. The next time you request a profile where a cached version is ok, it won’t even go to the server, it would use what the client has in-memory. Since this is in-memory, it will only be available until you shut down the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequent data retrieval errors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our approach here is exactly the same as our approach to latency: The user will initially see a default avatar and a peer ID but still have everything they need to start a conversation. The fact that the profile fetch may not succeed is really just a visual shortcoming. This is a form of progressive enhancement where we are starting with the bare minimum functionality and attempting to augment the experience along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Browsers live in a centralized world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This challenge was almost literally a world destroyer. If my memory serves me well, in OpenBazaar version 1.0 we had the chat app initialize before other important start-up functionality. For instance, while the chat app would be waiting on it’s multiple profiles to come back, the Notifications mini-app would be showing you a spinner. Even worse, if you wanted to actually navigate to a page in the app, the data needed to show the page would be queued until all those profile calls finished…which, lest we forget, could be minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a user experience deal breaker for those requests to be clogging up the queue and preventing critical functionality. But our hands were tied. If the browser imposes such a restriction, what could we do? Eventually, we stumbled upon the fact that the restriction is limited to HTTP requests. Incoming socket messages (which use TCP) have no such restriction. We added an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; flag to most of our APIs so that the HTTP request would immediately return with a unique &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;requestId&lt;/code&gt;. Subsequently, the profiles would come individually via socket messages. They would each include the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;requestId&lt;/code&gt; so we could map the profile to the initial request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boom! We could kick off as many profile calls as we wanted and have virtually no impact on the HTTP request queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-summary&quot;&gt;In Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While “world destroying” is a bit dramatic, these challenges were indeed &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; challenging! Decentralized applications with an intended user base of non-engineers (i.e. a client not meant to be used from the shell of your favorite exotic Unix distribution), are still rare and there just aren’t that many best practices in place yet. Existing best practices for front end development are for centralized apps and a lot of them go right out the window when you introduce the challenges of decentralized data retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decentralization is important though and, in my humble opinion, is here to stay. Over time, we’ll get there. Client developers will continue to come up with clever solutions and P2P libraries and browsers will iterate and improve. Similar to how email clients have come from being limited to the engineering labs of universities to now being used by your Grandma on her iPad, decentralized computing is coming soon to a grandma near you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">By Rob Misiorowski, OpenBazaar Front End Developer</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How To Get More Buyers on OpenBazaar with Categories and Tags</title><link href="https://openbazaar.org/blog/how-to-get-more-buyers-on-openbazaar-with-categories-and-tags/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How To Get &lt;span class='post-title-extra'&gt;More Buyers&lt;/span&gt; on OpenBazaar with &lt;span class='post-title-extra'&gt;Categories and Tags&lt;/span&gt;" /><published>2018-09-12T03:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-12T03:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://openbazaar.org/blog/how-to-get-more-buyers-on-openbazaar-with-categories-and-tags</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://openbazaar.org/blog/how-to-get-more-buyers-on-openbazaar-with-categories-and-tags/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Jason Hotelling, OpenBazaar Front End Developer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello! We hope you’re having a great time selling and sharing on the OpenBazaar platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenBazaar stores boast the fastest setup time of any ecommerce platform. With very little effort, you can set up your store and add listings in minutes. Then, a little extra work can give buyers an exceptional experience to make them want to visit again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we are going to talk about how to use tags and categories to help users find and browse your store with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;before-we-get-started&quot;&gt;Before We Get Started&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t already, please follow our guides to getting started with OpenBazaar. They contain instructions and tutorials that span from &lt;em&gt;Download&lt;/em&gt; through &lt;em&gt;Browsing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Selling&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you are new to OpenBazaar, we also recommend watching our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzlerMJMOu8&quot;&gt;OpenBazaar 2.0 Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mb-5&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe class=&quot;embed-responsive-item&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VzlerMJMOu8&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1-tags-are-for-search&quot;&gt;Step 1: Tags Are for Search&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tags&lt;/strong&gt; are one of the things search engines use to determine which listings to show to a potential buyer. Most users will discover your store through a listing that they find in search. For example, if a user is looking for t-shirts, they first navigate to the &lt;strong&gt;Discover&lt;/strong&gt; tab in OpenBazaar. Then they will select a search provider and enter a search term such as “t-shirt” or “t shirt”. In order for potential buyers to find &lt;em&gt;your shirts&lt;/em&gt;, you must enter any relevant tags on your listings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example, we have entered tags that may match what users enter in Search in the OpenBazaar Discover view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Add tags to your OpenBazaar listing.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Add tags to your OpenBazaar listing&quot; title=&quot;Add tags to your OpenBazaar listing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tip: Make sure to add your store name as a tag too so when people search for your store name, your listings will show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-categories-and-filters-in-your-store&quot;&gt;Step 2: Categories and Filters in Your Store&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once users click on your listing, they have the opportunity to visit your store by clicking “Go To Store” in the top left corner. This is where you have an opportunity to hook them and encourage them to shop around more. Your &lt;strong&gt;Store View&lt;/strong&gt; will show potential customers all your available listings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;OpenBazaar demo store - How To Get More Buyers on OpenBazar with Categories and Tags.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar demo store - How to get more buyers on OpenBazaar with categories and tags&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar demo store - How to get more buyers on OpenBazaar with categories and tags&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will make it easier for buyers to shop if you classify your listings. You should take time to become familiar with the Store View browsing experience. It will aid you later in planning and creating your store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;classify-your-listings-for-easy-store-browsing&quot;&gt;Classify Your Listings for Easy Store Browsing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Category radio buttons on OpenBazaar.png&quot; alt=&quot;Category radio buttons on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Category radio buttons on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little planning and foresight can make listing creation much easier. Determine which &lt;strong&gt;categories&lt;/strong&gt; and possible subcategories you’ll support in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our example store, Variety Bazaar, we have a wide variety of listings. We ensure a potential buyer can find what they want through useful categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Add categories to your OpenBazaar listing.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Add categories to your OpenBazaar listing&quot; title=&quot;Add categories to your OpenBazaar listing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter clear, concise and unique category names for your listings. For our example store, we sell clothing, antiques, comic books and fidget spinners. We decided to represent subcategories within clothing by applying more than one category. We also sell retro items within separate categories. These items are all given the extra category ‘retro’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important not to confuse tags with categories. Categories are for organizing your store and providing a simple store browsing experience. They are only used for filtering on the store view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;browsing-using-listing-filters&quot;&gt;Browsing Using Listing Filters&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When potential buyers browse your store, they will see a few useful filters to aid them. Understanding these filters will help you plan your store well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;store-search&quot;&gt;Store Search&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Store search bar on OpenBazaar.png&quot; alt=&quot;Store search bar on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Store search bar on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text entered into this &lt;strong&gt;store search&lt;/strong&gt; filters your listings based only on their titles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shipping&quot;&gt;Shipping&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Shipping to country and free shipping filter on OpenBazaar.png&quot; alt=&quot;Shipping to country and free shipping filter on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Shipping to country and free shipping filter on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Ships to&lt;/strong&gt; filter limits listings based on countries to which your listings ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Free Shipping&lt;/strong&gt; filter will toggle display of listings based on this option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note: This filter displays even if no listings offer free shipping. We encourage you to use it where you can! It makes a purchase more compelling for a buyer if they know they won’t also have to deal with extra shipping costs at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;category&lt;/strong&gt; filter is the primary method for which buyers will hone in on specific types of 
items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;type&lt;/strong&gt; filter allows buyers to view store listings based on the current supported types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Physical Good&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Digital Good&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cryptocurrency&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;toggle-view&quot;&gt;Toggle View&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over on the right side of your store users can toggle between list or grid view. &lt;strong&gt;Grid view&lt;/strong&gt; shows a much larger image providing a better visual shopping experience. This is the default view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Grid view of an OpenBazaar store.png&quot; alt=&quot;Grid view of an OpenBazaar store&quot; title=&quot;Grid view of an OpenBazaar store&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;List view&lt;/strong&gt; your listings are condensed so you can see more of them at one time. Each listing shows a small thumbnail of your product to the left and their prices on the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;List view of an OpenBazaar store.png&quot; alt=&quot;List view of an OpenBazaar store&quot; title=&quot;List view of an OpenBazaar store&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note: It’s important for your listings to have &lt;strong&gt;descriptive titles&lt;/strong&gt; as well as &lt;strong&gt;great photos&lt;/strong&gt; to draw in buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sort-by&quot;&gt;Sort By&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dropdown menu allows users to sort your store listings based on price or title. Sorting can be by highest to lowest price or vice-versa; alphabetical or reverse-alphabetical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spend time browsing other stores and take notes on your experience. Once you’re comfortable, its time to ensure your listings reflect a positive experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tip: Once you have a listing or two up, you can &lt;strong&gt;clone&lt;/strong&gt; them to spare yourself from duplicating redundant listing information. Remember to make sure you don’t leave any incorrect fields from the original listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a bit of extra time to plan and set up your store with care is important to drive its success. Achieving discoverability and browse-ability gets buyers in and keeps them around. Relevant tags added to your listings will increase discovery in search. Providing proper categories helps browsing users see what you offer. Finally, being familiar with your buyers’ experience will inform the best listing setup for your store.&lt;/p&gt;
