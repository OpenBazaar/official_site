&lt;p&gt;[10:12] Jacob Long: Does that include erc20?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:12] JoshJ: Eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:12] mg (OB1): It will not include ERC-20 when ETH initially launches, but we will chase it shortly afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:13] Jacob Long: USDC/DAI will help significantly with adoption IMO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:21] Jacob Long: I have been having many issues with disputes relating to the communication

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This post is a bit of speculation on creative use cases for OpenBazaar recently re-inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenBazaar/comments/9x4p69/openbazaar_more_than_just_your_standard_storefront/&quot;&gt;this community post on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. OpenBazaar is a simple cryptocurrency marketplace built on an open-source network that can be used, grown and changed by users around the world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let us know what your creative ideas for OpenBazaar are on &lt;a href=&quot;https://reddit.com/r/openbazaar&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/slack&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, or on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/openbazaar&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the holiday season again. Like many people, I have been thinking a lot about the stuff we acquire and exchange as a demonstration of love this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stuff.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Things.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Possessions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of us in the western world often have a lot of &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; already and this season encourages us to acquire more. It made me think about how many of us even really &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; how much stuff we already have and my fascination with the TV show American Pickers. If you haven’t watched it before, take 2 minutes to watch this clip:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mb-5&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe class=&quot;embed-responsive-item&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tKu-rCXkad4&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This clip demonstrates a few common themes in the show:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The owner of the item had lost track of where it was. Often in the show, the owners aren’t even aware of the item’s existence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The method to determine a price to sell the item was informal and time-consuming. There’s a good chance one of the parties in the trade was far away from a ‘market price’.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transactions are done in person, in cash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting of the show is somewhat unique; they typically find rural collectors who have barns full of old items. But some of the themes of the show are mirrored in the broader economy as well, at least in developed economies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-do-we-know-what-stuff-we-already-have&quot;&gt;How Do We Know What Stuff We Already Have?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping track of personal possessions depends largely on the individual, but it is usually done informally. Few people formally track all the objects they own. One popular method is simple: don’t keep track, and have periodic yard sales to deal with excess possessions. On a somewhat regular basis (typically each spring or summer), people will sort through their possessions and determine which items they want to keep, and which they are willing to sell. In this sense, a yard sale serves the following functions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Periodically &lt;strong&gt;updating your own knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; about your possessions and how much you value them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transmitting some of that information&lt;/strong&gt; to your local community by displaying those items publicly and pricing them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing the number of unwanted possessions&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;increasing cash&lt;/strong&gt; (or occasionally improve possessions through barter).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(As an aside, this might explain how ‘pickers’ can be successful; their physical presence and interest in your possessions is a simpler method for achieving these three functions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method of keeping track of possessions has worked well enough for most people, but it’s far from ideal. The largest cost is &lt;strong&gt;time&lt;/strong&gt;. Preparation requires manually sorting goods and determining their price, physically sorting them (and putting back what wasn’t sold later), then waiting for others to take an interest in them. A yard sale typically takes at least a day’s worth of activity. The haggling itself - similar to the pickers - benefits those who have more information about the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advent of the Internet is already allowing better methods. Online platforms for buying and selling goods allow people to more effectively sell their unwanted possessions by opening up the information beyond the local community. However, these platforms have significant drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The platforms &lt;strong&gt;charge fees&lt;/strong&gt;, and the payment methods they use often charge fees as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The platforms &lt;strong&gt;monitor the data&lt;/strong&gt; of the people listing their possessions, which is &lt;strong&gt;typically tied to their real-world identity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The platforms have their own &lt;strong&gt;restrictions around listing possessions&lt;/strong&gt;, from type of goods they allow to the length of time they can be hosted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using these platforms is an incremental improvement over the yard sale. It still requires manually assessing and valuing your own possessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-openbazaar-and-bitcoin-can-manage-personal-possessions&quot;&gt;How OpenBazaar and Bitcoin can Manage Personal Possessions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;tracking_personal_inventory_on_openbazaar.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tracking Personal Inventory on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Tracking Personal Inventory on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/download&quot;&gt;OpenBazaar&lt;/a&gt; is a decentralized network for trade; users run the software locally and connect directly to other users to buy and sell goods and services. There is no central institution to take a cut, monitor data, or restrict trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; is a digital currency and payment network; users control their own money locally and aren’t reliant on banks or payment processors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these platforms could change the way we keep track of our personal possessions. Our own knowledge of our possessions - and their value - doesn’t need to be manually re-evaluated informally and periodically, but instead continually tracked and updated. Nor does this information need to be manually transmitted to the local or global community; it can be automatically (and anonymously) displayed to the world, continuously, at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be achieved by representing possessions as &lt;strong&gt;Ricardian contracts&lt;/strong&gt; (I’ll just refer to them as contracts), and publishing them to the OpenBazaar network. Ricardian contracts are a data structure that allows goods and services to be represented electronically; these contracts allow users to put in any information about a possession as well as the price they value the good at. When a user creates a contract, the OpenBazaar client publishes the information to the network, and other users can view that contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they choose, the user could put in a price for which they’d be willing to sell the item. If anyone in the world values that possession more than the current owner, they could instantly make an offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a user isn’t willing to sell a possession, they could simply create a contract and choose to keep the information about it stored locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-downside&quot;&gt;The Downside&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retroactively listing possessions as contracts would be time-consuming. However, if a user were to begin creating contracts for all new possessions they gain, eventually most or all of their possessions would be recorded as contracts in their OpenBazaar client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-present-and-the-future&quot;&gt;The Present and The Future&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, much of commerce is already moving to the Internet, and the process of recording information about possessions is moving from a manual task to one which could easily be automated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you acquire an item via OpenBazaar, this could be done easily. Information about the contract purchased would simply change ownership to the new user. Using other major platforms could also be simple with importing tools, likely done via a browser plugin or something similar. Anything purchased via Amazon would automatically be represented as a contract. Apps using UPC scanners could automatically create contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This system would allow all possessions to have a continuous digital representation, and associated value, at no cost to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What’s an &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/download&quot;&gt;OpenBazaar&lt;/a&gt; user to do when they find themselves already in December and they still need to buy some gifts and/or squeeze in a few more sales?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, disaster can still be avoided with a quick pause to regroup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;OpenBazaar_Shopping_and_Selling_Survival_Guide_Gift.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Shopping and Selling Survival Guide Gift&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar Shopping and Selling Survival Guide Gift&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buyers:&lt;/strong&gt; are you running a little behind and still need a great gift for the other cryptocurrency lovers in your life? Make a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; statement by using your coins to buy their gifts on OpenBazaar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get shopping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t already, start browsing now! &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com&quot;&gt;OpenBazaar.com&lt;/a&gt; makes this incredibly easy for you to do anywhere you have an internet-connected device. When you are ready to buy your gifts, just open the same listings with your desktop app to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember production and shipping times&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most vendors on OpenBazaar are individuals or small businesses who run everything themselves. You may have just fallen in love with an item but if you need it by a specific time, make sure the vendor can deliver it by then. For custom or handmade goods, be sure to check with the vendor about what they have ready to ship and their current production &amp;amp; shipping times. Also note where in the world they are shipping from to estimate how long it will take to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for deals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of OpenBazaar vendors are still offering promotions right now like this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;use coupon code &amp;quot;xmas&amp;quot; to get %15 off any shirts for your super normal presents for people this holiday season. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/bZImpRezxp&quot;&gt;https://t.co/bZImpRezxp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if btc, use &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/openbazaar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@openbazaar&lt;/a&gt; discount already included in price ob://QmTwutUrwXS3bh5rfSXriJCNayToD44VpWJbm6DwKuVc2U/store&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; YOUR HYDRA (@BraveTheWorld) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BraveTheWorld/status/1070474239826771968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 6, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still some nice deals to be had out there so keep an eye out for them. We will be sharing any great deals we find on our social media, too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sellers:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you still want to earn a few more cryptocoins this month? Here are some tips to do so and not run yourself ragged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check in with yourself and your business&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, a bit more Bitcoin is always great but make sure you are realistic about what it will take you to get through any additional orders this month so that you don’t overextend yourself. Account for how long it takes you to make, acquire, package and send your items and about how long it takes to arrive in different locations so that you can advise your buyers well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know your cutoff time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you know the last day you can accept orders in order to get them to buyers before the holiday they are celebrating. This is especially important if you do handmade or other custom work. Also, do you want to take some time off this month? Make sure you aren’t chasing orders into your own holiday and &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002765331-How-do-I-turn-my-store-off-or-go-on-vacation-mode-&quot;&gt;set your OpenBazaar store to “off”&lt;/a&gt; a few days prior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote &amp;amp; offer incentives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great way to promote yourself and encourage a little sales push is to use social media to talk about special offers you have. Vendors are still offering incentives for buyers like discounts and bonus gifts right now. If your capacity allows for it, give your potential buyers some extra reasons to give their business to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; over the hundreds of other vendors competing for their attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all still have some work left to do if we celebrate holidays in December so while this may not &lt;em&gt;eliminate&lt;/em&gt; stress, hopefully thinking through these things can help you minimize it.&lt;/p&gt;

To read a summary of the last year, read &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/big-change-hard-work-and-strong-growth-openbazaar-2-turns-1/&quot;&gt;Brian Hoffman’s piece&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenBazaar started more than four years ago, and for everyone involved it has been an incredible learning experience. Here are a few lessons we’ve learned over the years, with a particular emphasis on the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-expect-politics&quot;&gt;1. Expect politics.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like Bitcoin, OpenBazaar is an open source piece of software and a network of people running the software. As such, it’s incapable of having a “position” on any given issue. However, the individuals and companies building OpenBazaar do have opinions about issues in the cryptocurrency space. When they promote these beliefs – particularly on controversial issues – others will often claim “OpenBazaar believes X” instead of correctly attributing the opinion to the individual or company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we started building OpenBazaar in mid-2014 the community of people using cryptocurrencies was smaller, primarily focused on Bitcoin, and the majority of people agreed that building infrastructure in order to use cryptocurrency was worthwhile and necessary for broader adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few years the community got larger and also began to disagree on the future of Bitcoin, such as how (or even if) it should scale. OpenBazaar itself played no role in this “scaling debate,” remaining neutral and following whichever chain the market decided upon. While the project itself was neutral, the individuals and companies working on OpenBazaar weren’t. In the new tribalist atmosphere created during the block size debate, this caused many to ascribe the individual positions of developers to the project itself, leading some to withdrawal their support and no longer use the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For better or worse, the cryptocurrency space has become politicized over the past few years, and we now recognize the importance of emphasizing the project’s neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-plan-for-all-possible-future-scenariosincluding-unfavorable-ones&quot;&gt;2. Plan for all possible future scenarios—including unfavorable ones.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lesson learned is also related to the scaling debate mentioned above. We recognized the possibility that fees could get high enough to prevent people from using Bitcoin for commerce. As individuals and as a company we supported efforts to keep Bitcoin functioning and not get to that point. Unfortunately, it happened anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the day OpenBazaar 2.0 launched the average Bitcoin fee was ~$5 per transaction and rising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though we already knew high fees were a possibility, this all happened in a very short timeframe and forced us to react as quickly as possible. Since Bitcoin &lt;strong&gt;wasn’t usable for commerce at that moment&lt;/strong&gt;, we decided to add support for new, usable cryptocurrencies into the client immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This put us in the situation of publishing a Bitcoin-only product in November of 2017 and then needing to put all our development efforts into making it a multi-coin product immediately afterwards, which was several months of work. Had we decided at the beginning to build OpenBazaar 2.0 with support for multiple coins it likely would have been simpler and the resulting UX would have been better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing about future scenarios and trying to make or prevent them from happening isn’t sufficient. You need to have plans in place for facing whatever reality meets your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-dont-get-overly-focused-on-a-single-product&quot;&gt;3. Don’t get overly focused on a single product.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenBazaar is a desktop application. This is primarily for technical reasons; building a completely peer-to-peer application is tough for desktop only and even more so in a web browser or on a mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second reason is due to momentum. We started on desktop and have continued iterating on desktop because, while it has been a difficult undertaking, it was one we became very familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com&quot;&gt;Web&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ob1.io/&quot;&gt;mobile&lt;/a&gt; are implementations we are actively working on and have dreamed of realizing since the beginning, but they require very different engineering approaches and even philosophies. For them to begin development we had to deliberately choose to direct significant resources to them and many of the decisions made along these paths have not been easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web-connected technology is evolving quickly now and organizations working in a sector like cryptocurrencies need to demonstrate 2 extremes: &lt;strong&gt;focus&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;. People are solving hard problems every day using this very new technology while also facing a growing market with changing desires. They need to be both steadfast &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; nimble to tackle each day that may change all of their grandest plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve learned a lot about developing open source software, managing a community and dealing with the changes and growth of cryptocurrencies over the past few years, and we certainly haven’t been perfect. We appreciate the knowledge we have gained, and are executing against it in our daily work. We look forward to learning much more as we continue building the largest and most free decentralized ecommerce platform on the internet with you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This month we’ve been celebrating the one year anniversary of OpenBazaar 2.0.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chat log:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[09:59] mg: Hi kornilov. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:00] mg: Heard you learned how to feed chickens over the internet with magic internet money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:00] kornilov: Hi developers and Jenn. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:02] kornilov: Yes, I have learned to make ethereum testnet token - korncoin ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:02] mg: I was unaware of that! I was talking about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/redpepper261&quot;&gt;BCH chicken feeder/webcam&lt;/a&gt;. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:04] kornilov: Oh, that is supposed to be a secret project available only for NSA. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:04] mg: Haha… I’ll make sure to keep my lips sealed. :X&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:10] joshj: One minor clarification, ETH uses Infura, not Insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:19] chris.troutner: 18!? That’s fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:20] Rod: Is there a general timeline/estimate for when 2.3 will be released?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:22] kornilov: How many fulltime employed developers OB has?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:22] kornilov: very nice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:23] Rod: Have there been any updates for downloading offline messages quicker in the current client?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:23] Rod: I have done some prototypes for putting together OB features in the browser and the amount of time it takes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:26] chris.troutner: Sorry about that. My connection is sketchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:26] Rod: I did some testing with doing full IPNS crawl on a shorter interval and did not see any significant increase in resources used. Do you know if there is a specific reason the crawl speed is at the current speed it is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:26] Rod: I can follow up on slack later if needed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:27] chris.troutner: I just wanted to say congrats on the Hacktoberfest results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:28] Rod: Alright thank you Chris&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:28] chris.troutner: If OB wants to investigate BCH token integration (Wormhole or SLP), perhaps we could use it as an opportunity to incentivize community developers through swag and bounties, like gitcash.io or Gitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This is a video recording of the OpenBazaar Developer call on November 8, 2018.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How Will The BCH Hard Fork Affect OpenBazaar?</title><link href="https://openbazaar.org/blog/how-will-the-bch-hard-fork-on-nov-15-affect-openbazaar/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How Will The &lt;span class='post-title-extra'&gt;BCH Hard Fork&lt;/span&gt; Affect OpenBazaar?" /><published>2018-11-12T09:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-11-12T09:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://openbazaar.org/blog/how-will-the-bch-hard-fork-on-nov-15-affect-openbazaar</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://openbazaar.org/blog/how-will-the-bch-hard-fork-on-nov-15-affect-openbazaar/">&lt;h4 id=&quot;whats-happening-with-bitcoin-cash&quot;&gt;What’s Happening with Bitcoin Cash?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bitcoincash.org/&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Cash&lt;/a&gt; network upgrade beginning at 4:40PM UTC on November 15th, 2018. Depending on how the upgrade is accepted by the network, the Bitcoin Cash blockchain could fork into two or more incompatible chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that transacting is dangerous during a hard fork like this unless it’s between addresses you entirely control. If you transact BCH to an address you don’t control you could lose access to your coins on other forks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to help OpenBazaar users prepare for the hard fork, here is some information about the OpenBazaar wallet that can help you decide how to handle any BCH you may have stored there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-will-the-bitcoin-cash-upgrade-affect-my-openbazaar-funds&quot;&gt;How Will The Bitcoin Cash Upgrade Affect My OpenBazaar Funds?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users of &lt;strong&gt;OpenBazaar 2.2.5 and prior&lt;/strong&gt; who have an active BCH wallet are using a local SPV-based wallet. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/simplified-payment-verification&quot;&gt;SPV wallets&lt;/a&gt; are designed to follow the chain that has the most cumulative proof-of-work according to the existing Bitcoin Cash difficulty rules. The SPV wallet in OpenBazaar will follow the longest chain served by the peers it’s able to connect to. We advise that you withdraw your BCH from your OpenBazaar wallet until the chains settle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;withdraw-your-bch-to-electron&quot;&gt;Withdraw Your BCH to Electron&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Users of an OpenBazaar wallet control their funds by having sole access to their keys. The wallet maintains its keys and seed locally on your computer which you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002892791-How-do-I-backup-my-OpenBazaar-wallet-&quot;&gt;backup to a safe location using these steps&lt;/a&gt;. Then, import your seed into a &lt;strong&gt;BIP39-compatible wallet&lt;/strong&gt; (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://electroncash.org/&quot;&gt;Electron Cash&lt;/a&gt; ) to keep your funds safe through the fork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ob1.io&quot;&gt;OB1&lt;/a&gt; team will continue to observe the network upgrade and will take further actions as necessary to ensure the safety of our users’ funds at rest within the OpenBazaar wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-should-i-do-next&quot;&gt;What Should I Do Next?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next few weeks, make sure you have the keys to your OpenBazaar wallet stored somewhere safe as complications may arise. When things settle it is entirely your choice what you do with your coins, but we also recommend being cautious of a chain with hash power of 50% or more controlled by one entity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;
