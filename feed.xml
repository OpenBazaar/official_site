&lt;p&gt;When we were designing &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/download&quot;&gt;OpenBazaar&lt;/a&gt;, now the world’s largest decentralized marketplace, we knew the general approach to creating a &lt;strong&gt;search engine&lt;/strong&gt; that delivered high quality results was to use a centralized server to index listings and run search queries. A centralized search experience, however, was completely out of line with the &lt;strong&gt;freedom&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;flexibility&lt;/strong&gt; this open-source marketplace represents. We knew there had to be some intermediate step we could take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-federated-approach&quot;&gt;A Federated Approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to do what few other platforms have done and open it up so that &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/decentralized-search-and-content-discovery-on-openbazaar/&quot;&gt;anyone can create a search engine that is compatible with the OpenBazaar app&lt;/a&gt;. This would allow us to start by building our own search engine to help users navigate the network but would relieve their total reliance on it. All the data that needs to be indexed is &lt;strong&gt;public&lt;/strong&gt; and anyone can create and run a search engine of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;building-a-search-engine-for-openbazaar&quot;&gt;Building a Search Engine for OpenBazaar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have written a brief overview of how to build a search engine for OpenBazaar and described some of the outstanding issues we are still working on. It does take some technical skill to build a search engine, but developers with previous experience building and maintaining online infrastructure should be able to create a simple version without too much difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1---finding-peers&quot;&gt;Step 1 - Finding Peers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step one is to build a database of all the peers you want index. There are several ways you can do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Actively crawl the network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The openbazaar-go API provides a couple of APIs to make this easy. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/ob/peers&lt;/code&gt; returns a list of peers you’re connected to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;ob peers.png&quot; alt=&quot;ob peers - How To Build a Search Engine on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;ob peers - How To Build a Search Engine on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/ob/closestpeers/&amp;lt;peerID&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; returns a list of “closer” peers from the DHT. One can crawl the network for more nodes just by iterating over your current peer database and fetching closer peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;ob closest peers.png&quot; alt=&quot;ob closest peers - How To Build a Search Engine on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;ob closest peers - How To Build a Search Engine on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/ob/peerinfo/&amp;lt;peerID&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; endpoint to look at their IP address if you wanted to index only Tor stores, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Passively listen for new peers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this you’d likely want several nodes running at the same time. From there you could stream
peerIDs to your database every time one of your nodes receives a new connection. You might not get all peers this way but you should find most. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;openbazaar-go&lt;/code&gt; nodes do not expose an API which streams new peer connections so you’d have to patch a node to get this data. Creating such an API should be relatively easy and it’s something we are considering doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Subscribe to pubsub&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are just now starting to make use of the libp2p’s pubsub capabilities. Currently only IPNS data is broadcast to pubsub channels but hopefully relatively soon we will have all nodes announce new publishes over a pubsub channel. Normal users will not be subscribed to this data–as it is a lot of data–but for people who are building search engines this would be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on what data we include in the publish, you should be able to subscribe to the appropriate channel and receive streaming updates from every peer. We’ll be sure to announce and document this functionality when it is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Manual curation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could also just manually enter the peerIDs of stores you find interesting in your database. This isn’t actually a bad strategy if you want your search engine to target specific types of products. Complex machine learning algorithms would likely also work for this if you are particularly adventurous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2---indexing-stores&quot;&gt;Step 2 - Indexing Stores&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a list of stores it’s time to index them. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/ob/listings/&amp;lt;peerID&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; will give you a list of all the store’s listings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;indexing stores on openbazaar.png&quot; alt=&quot;Indexing Stores on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Indexing Stores on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you grab the hash from a listing you can get the full details by using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/ob/listing/&amp;lt;peerID&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;hash&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;ob listing peerid hash.png&quot; alt=&quot;ob listing peerid hash - How To Build a Search Engine on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;ob listing peerid hash - How To Build a Search Engine on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will also need the user’s profile which you can get from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/ob/profile/&amp;lt;peerID&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;ob profile peerid.png&quot; alt=&quot;ob profile peerid - How To Build a Search Engine on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;ob profile peerid - How To Build a Search Engine on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can put the listings in whatever database you please to index and search them. Your API just needs to conform to the specification in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenBazaar/obips/blob/master/obip-0002.md&quot;&gt;OBIP2&lt;/a&gt; and it will be compatible with the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see your search engine when your stores are indexed, enter the URL here in the OpenBazaar client:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;add your search engine to openbazaar.png&quot; alt=&quot;Add your search engine to OpenBazaar - How To Build a Search Engine on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Add your search engine to OpenBazaar - How To Build a Search Engine on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-3---keeping-content-fresh&quot;&gt;Step 3 - Keeping Content Fresh&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge with running a search engine is avoiding serving stale content. Given that OpenBazaar is still fairly new, users may come and go frequently. You want to avoid serving listings for stores where the owner has not been online in a long time to make sure to give potential buyers a fresh discovery experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, listings are not guaranteed to persist on the network longer than a week after a vendor has gone offline. It still &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be visible to some users due to caching, but not everyone may be able to see the listing. If you serve old listings, a potential buyer might click on it only to get a Not Found error. We recommend not serving listings from vendors which have not been identified as being online at least once within the past week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you determine that? Admittedly this is an area where we are still working to improve but there are a few ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, make sure your database of peerIDs also tracks the last seen or last good timestamp for the peer. Next, you have several ways you could update the timestamp:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Ping each peer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/ob/status/&amp;lt;peerID&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; endpoint will attempt to ping them and tell you if they are online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;ob status peerid endpoint.png&quot; alt=&quot;ob status peerid endpoint - How To Build a Search Engine on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;ob status peerid endpoint - How To Build a Search Engine on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, however, is that about 60% of nodes on the network are unreachable due to NAT traversal issues. Tor nodes tend to have even worse issues as many users run on operating systems like Tails and Whonix which lock down the control port and make it difficult to accept incoming connections. So this only gets you part of the way there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Passively listen for incoming connections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is similar to 2) above in Finding Peers. You could update the timestamp for a peer every time they connect to you but again this will either require patching your node or for us to provide an API to get the data. This also will not cover every peer you’re interested in unless you run many nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Disable caching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you set &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;UsePersistentCache&quot;: false&lt;/code&gt; in your node’s config file it will stop returning from cache and will do a new DHT crawl each time you request user data. If the data has dropped out of the network, you will know about it as the data will return not found. If it’s not found, you should generally not serve up that peer’s data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you’ll likely also want to set &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&quot;BackUpAPI&quot;: &quot;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; in the config as by default it will try to get the record from our gateway’s cache if the record cannot be found in the DHT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Use IPNS record validity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time a user publishes new content they publish an IPNS record containing an expiration date in the DHT. That expiration date is the time at which the user’s listings will drop out of the network absent them re-publishing which happens automatically when their node starts up and once a day thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you query for a user’s listings or profile or anything else, your node looks up the IPNS record. You could theoretically use this expiration date as a proxy for the last good timestamp for the peer and beyond that stop serving their listings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This data is not yet exposed in our API and it’s something that we have on our list to develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Use pubsub&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, whenever you query for a peer’s data, it subscribes to streaming updates for that peer. This means you’ll be notified immediately whenever they publish a new IPNS record. Not only does this tell you when they have signed online, but you could also get the latest IPNS record validity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, disabling cache–3) above–also disables pubsub and would make this method ineffective. This is another issue that we are working on improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-4---making-money&quot;&gt;Step 4 - Making Money!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s entirely possible for you to monetize your work on an OpenBazaar search engine by adding paid ads in your search results. In fact, you could pretty easy sell ad space for your search engine through your own OpenBazaar store!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;issues-and-improvements&quot;&gt;Issues and Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a general overview of the technical work required for building an OpenBazaar search engine. We’re aware of some areas we would like to improve upon such as creating an API that allows us to stream newly found peerIDs and also have APIs that allow us to inspect IPNS records or pubsub publishes to update our timestamp associated with each peer. We could likely combine all of this into one streaming API that pulls data from all these sources and streams not only new peerIDs that it finds, but also the most up-to-date timestamp for that peer that it is able to decipher. This way search engines only need a single API to update their peers database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are constantly working to make it easier for anyone to jump right in and start building on the OpenBazaar platform. If you have any questions or comments about any of this, please join our conversation in &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/slack&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; and tell us what you think.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">by OpenBazaar Lead Backend Developer Chris Pacia</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Decentralized Search and Content Discovery on OpenBazaar</title><link href="https://openbazaar.org/blog/decentralized-search-and-content-discovery-on-openbazaar/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Decentralized &lt;span class='post-title-extra'&gt;Search and Content Discovery&lt;/span&gt; on OpenBazaar" /><published>2018-08-21T14:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-08-21T14:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://openbazaar.org/blog/decentralized-search-and-content-discovery-on-openbazaar</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://openbazaar.org/blog/decentralized-search-and-content-discovery-on-openbazaar/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by OpenBazaar Developer Tyler Smith&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content discovery&lt;/strong&gt; is a crucial component to any ecommerce system, especially 2-sided marketplaces where users are both the buyers and the sellers. Even if vendors have listed a number of great products, if users can’t find things they want then they won’t become buyers. &lt;strong&gt;Centralized&lt;/strong&gt; 2-sided marketplaces like Amazon and Etsy have been able to build robust discovery tools because they control the platform and are able to collect every bit of user data generated there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;decentralized&lt;/strong&gt; marketplace like OpenBazaar removes the opportunity for a single organization to own and control all data which creates advantages for users in giving them more freedom and privacy but it also presents some challenges for creating a good content discovery system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A truly decentralized answer to easy and elegant content discovery does not yet exist but we have developed an approach to help buyers find things they want and need in this growing marketplace while still honoring a valuable principle that decentralization provides: &lt;strong&gt;choice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Search Providers in OpenBazaar.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Search Providers in OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Search Providers in OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;federation-a-stop-between-centralization-and-full-decentralization&quot;&gt;Federation: A stop between centralization and full decentralization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In version 1.0 of OpenBazaar we tried our hand at a truly decentralized search index but the results were less than ideal. The technology is just not there yet. In response to the search deficiencies then, the market acted in the form of DuoSearch, which was a company that decided to build a crawler for the network and maintain their own centralized index. Users had to leave the OpenBazaar app and go to the DuoSearch website to easily browse items. Once they discovered items they wanted to by, they had to return to the app to make the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For version 2.0 we knew we wanted a system that could be as nice to use as DuoSearch, from inside the app, and without requiring all users to use a single, centralized search engine. The solution is &lt;strong&gt;a federated search system&lt;/strong&gt; that anybody can participate in. In version 2.0, each search provider can build and maintain their own view of the network but conform with a common interface that allows them to be used interchangably in systems. Nobody has an upper hand and everybody can compete on quality and features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;basics-of-building-a-search-api-for-openbazaar&quot;&gt;Basics of building a search API for OpenBazaar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anybody can build a search provider that can be added to the client by ensuring their API is compliant with &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/tyler-smith/44b5cc8065042f221630cb5c8be505bf&quot;&gt;OBIP2&lt;/a&gt; which defines a spec for how the OpenBazaar client and search providers interact. Any API following the spec can be consumed by OBIP2 clients which means anybody can build their own search engine any way they’d like to. They show any listings they want, any filters they want, and score results any way they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to serve search results a, search developer needs to crawl the network using the OpenBazaar server API and index the results into a system like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/&quot;&gt;Elasticsearch&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.algolia.com/&quot;&gt;Algolia&lt;/a&gt;. They also need to frequently re-check their data to ensure the content is still available on the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After indexing all the data they need to build an API satisfying the OBIP2 interface so that OpenBazaar users can add the root URL to their client and begin using the search engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;customizing-your-search-experience&quot;&gt;Customizing your search experience&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A search provider could be completely free for use, monetize their search by selling paid promotion slots, or sell premium search endpoints. It’s entirely up to them how they’d like to run it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every provider decides what results to show for any given query and they define their own filtering and sorting options. This allows them do things like experiment with new features or specialize in only certain types of listings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone could create a food-oriented search where users can filter by types of food or ingredients and sort by nutritional value. Or a search engine for clothing with options related sizes and styles. The OpenBazaar protocol and applications have no concern for what data is being served, as long as it’s being served in the proper format for users to access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;common-issues-and-future-improvements&quot;&gt;Common issues and future improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crawling the network and keeping the data fresh is the most challenging part of building a search provider. Search providers want to make sure everything they serve is still available on the network. They also don’t want to serve listings whose names have expired on the network which can be tricky to track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future we plan to make this much easier and more reliable by utilizing &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipfs.io/blog/25-pubsub/&quot;&gt;PubSub in IPFS&lt;/a&gt; to broadcast updates that anybody can listen for. Providers will only need to listen on the update channel to get all the information necessary to update their index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re aware that the tooling and documentation around the lower level details on how to build a working crawler could stand to be improved. We are working on a future post that goes into more technical details and explanations and are considering how we can create open tooling to make it as easy as possible for anybody to participate in the OpenBazaar content provider ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">by OpenBazaar Developer Tyler Smith</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">OpenBazaar Developer Call - August 16, 2018</title><link href="https://openbazaar.org/blog/OpenBazaar-Developer-Call-August-16-2018/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="OpenBazaar Developer Call - August 16, 2018" /><published>2018-08-16T14:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-08-16T14:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://openbazaar.org/blog/OpenBazaar-Developer-Call-August-16-2018</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://openbazaar.org/blog/OpenBazaar-Developer-Call-August-16-2018/">&lt;p&gt;This is a video recording of the OpenBazaar Developer call on August 16, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:09] chris.troutner: There have been some new hires and a lot of changes. Could we get a brief run-down of an org chart. Like who is kind of overseeing what subcomponents of OB?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:13] chris.troutner: I’d love to hear some details/preview of the API wallet vs Etherium. Technical difficulties/gotchas, etc. Other than the OB token, what is the goals of the Ethereum wallet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:17] Gustavo Frederico: Hi - is there any known project for integration between OB and other traditional e-commerce platforms? (SAP Hybris, Oracle ATG commerce, Elastic Path, Magento, Sitecore, etc )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:21] Gustavo Frederico: Excellent!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:22] chris.troutner: Can you guys remind me on the difference between hitting the ‘Reload Transactions’ button vs deleting the header.bin file?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:23] mg (OB): Reload button is a soft reset. Deleting the headers.bin is the hard reset. Let me know if you want more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:23] chris.troutner: Thats good&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:24] chris.troutner: Since we’re on the topic of APIs and integrations, I’ll put this link here to the node.js library for interfacing with the OB API:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[10:25] mg (OB): Gustavo, it sounds like you may have a use case in mind. If there is, I’d be curious what so we can make sure to improve those docs to that end.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This is a video recording of the OpenBazaar Developer call on August 16, 2018.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Summer Stats and How To Get $10 in BTC for Your First Purchase on OpenBazaar</title><link href="https://openbazaar.org/blog/Summer-Stats-and-How-To-Get-10-in-BTC-for-Your-First-Purchase/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Summer Stats and How To Get &lt;span class='post-title-extra'&gt;$10 in BTC&lt;/span&gt; for Your First Purchase on OpenBazaar" /><published>2018-08-15T14:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-08-15T14:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://openbazaar.org/blog/Summer-Stats-and-How-To-Get-10-in-BTC-for-Your-First-Purchase</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://openbazaar.org/blog/Summer-Stats-and-How-To-Get-10-in-BTC-for-Your-First-Purchase/">&lt;p&gt;For those of us in the northern hemisphere, summer is waning - and we miss it already. We’ve had an excellent season so far with the release of some new features and seeing a pop of new users come in. We want to keep the fun going just a little bit longer by &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com/bitcoin-promotion&quot;&gt;giving away some bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;here-are-a-few-things-we-are-proud-of-accomplishing-this-summer&quot;&gt;Here are a few things we are proud of accomplishing this summer:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launched&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/New-OpenBazaar-Release-Enables-Trading-1500-Cryptocurrencies/&quot;&gt;peer-to-peer trading over 1,500 cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt; with seller’s choice of adding a markup or discount&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Built&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com&quot;&gt;a whole new website&lt;/a&gt; just for browsing OpenBazaar on the web&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcomed&lt;/strong&gt; thousands of new users from over 125 different countries into the OpenBazaar network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited to see people trading cryptocurrencies and easily sharing their stores and listings on social media. Very soon they will also be able to make and take payments in &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; wallet with their choice of &lt;strong&gt;five&lt;/strong&gt; different coins!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are constantly working to make decentralized ecommerce extremely beautiful and accessible for everyone, everywhere on earth. And we couldn’t do it without people from so many different places developing, trading and participating right alongside us, telling us what they think and helping us make this thing better every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want you to try it and tell us about it, too. To sweeten the already awesome deal of checking out the future of ecommerce, we want to give you &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com/bitcoin-promotion&quot;&gt;$10 BTC toward your first purchase on OpenBazaar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com/bitcoin-promotion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Get $10 Bitcoin for OpenBazaar.png&quot; alt=&quot;How To Get $10 in BTC for Your First Purchase on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;How To Get $10 in BTC for Your First Purchase on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, we’re just &lt;em&gt;giving away $10 in bitcoin&lt;/em&gt; so you can try OpenBazaar for yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we aren’t even being creepy about it. You don’t need to already have or send bitcoin to anybody else nor spam everyone you’ve ever met. You just need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com/bitcoin-promotion&quot;&gt;follow these short instructions&lt;/a&gt; and we will send $10 BTC to your OpenBazaar wallet so you can shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all we have for now. Grab your &lt;strong&gt;free bitcoin&lt;/strong&gt; and we’ll see you in the marketplace!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">For those of us in the northern hemisphere, summer is waning - and we miss it already.

We’re glad you want to buy goods, services and cryptocurrency on OpenBazaar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can start by casually browsing what’s available in this decentralized marketplace at &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com&quot;&gt;openbazaar.com&lt;/a&gt;. When you’re ready to buy, this handy guide will show you how you can set up an OpenBazaar profile, step by step. It only takes a few minutes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any difficulties along the way, please visit our &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/support&quot;&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; page for ways to get in touch with us and let us know. If you want to chat with someone from the OpenBazaar community for help, or to give feedback on how OpenBazaar is working for you, join our &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/slack&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1--download-and-install-openbazaar&quot;&gt;Step 1 – Download and Install OpenBazaar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most users will want to download the package that matches their operating system from our website at &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/download&quot;&gt;openbazaar.org/download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have some technical expertise and want to manually install OpenBazaar, read &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-go/tree/master/docs/&quot;&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2--run-openbazaar&quot;&gt;Step 2 – Run OpenBazaar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time you run OpenBazaar you will be guided through a short &lt;strong&gt;onboarding process&lt;/strong&gt; to setup and personalize your &lt;strong&gt;node&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your OpenBazaar &lt;strong&gt;node&lt;/strong&gt; is similar to an account or profile on a traditional website but with an important difference: &lt;em&gt;you own it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With websites, you create your user account on a server that someone else, like Amazon or Ebay, owns entirely. This is kind of like renting an apartment in a building that they own. When you are “leasing” space on a regular website this way, they control how you access it, too. They give you “keys” that you use to access your account–your login and password–and they can also revoke them at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With OpenBazaar, you create and own &lt;strong&gt;your own server&lt;/strong&gt;–your &lt;strong&gt;node!&lt;/strong&gt;–that participates in the marketplace network, and all data you create lives on &lt;strong&gt;your own computer&lt;/strong&gt;. This is like building your own independent house that has a private entrance only you can find so no login or password are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since your node and profile live entirely on your own computer, someone would have to access your computer directly in order to make changes to it or take it down. This is more secure than how websites operate though it requires a little bit more knowledge to manage. For example, if you want to access your profile from another computer, you have to move all of your files to that other computer. To “close” your account, you simply &lt;strong&gt;delete your files from your computer&lt;/strong&gt; following &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012910151&quot;&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are working to make this more flexible in the future so that you have the option to set up your profile or store to be accessible from various devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;onboarding-setup&quot;&gt;Onboarding Setup&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Get Started.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Get Started&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Get Started&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you go! Time to Get Started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Cryptocurrency Wallet Setup.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Cryptocurrency Wallet Setup&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Cryptocurrency Wallet Setup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First you will be asked to set up your integrated cryptocurrency wallet. Right now this includes Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Zcash (beta). At this time you can only select one to start but if you would like the option to shop with more of the available currencies you can add additional wallets after this first setup which is described later in this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Add Your Info.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Add Your Info&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Add Your Info&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you will be asked a few questions such as your name, description of your profile/store, country, and preferred display currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also have the opportunity to upload an avatar for your profile. Click on &lt;strong&gt;Select Avatar&lt;/strong&gt; to choose a file from your computer. Recommendations here are to choose a nice, uncomplicated avatar that scales well into a circle frame as it will appear around the application. Avatars should be a square at least 280px by 280px or larger for best visual appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Terms of Service.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Terms of Service&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Terms of Service&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is a disclaimer about using the OpenBazaar software, which you should read before continuing because OpenBazaar is an unique and new kind of marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Optional Opt-In Metrics.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Optional Opt-In Metrics&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Optional Opt-In Metrics&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you will see a screen asking you to opt into &lt;strong&gt;optional analytics collection&lt;/strong&gt;. This is your choice and even if you change your mind you can always opt in or out again at any time in your &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding - Your New Profile Store Page.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Your New Profile Store Page&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Your New Profile Store Page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing onboarding, you’ll now see your own &lt;strong&gt;OpenBazaar Store page&lt;/strong&gt;. Each user has their own profile and store on the OpenBazaar network by default but if you are just joining as a buyer you don’t need Click on &lt;strong&gt;Home&lt;/strong&gt; in the menu near the top to see your regular profile page and make changes as you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3--search--buy&quot;&gt;Step 3 – Search &amp;amp; Buy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To browse items, click the &lt;strong&gt;OpenBazaar tent icon&lt;/strong&gt; to the right of the address bar at the top of your client window to &lt;strong&gt;Discover&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;OpenBazaar Discover Screen.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Discover Screen&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar Discover Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will see the &lt;strong&gt;Discover&lt;/strong&gt; bar at the top which shows the integrated search engines you can use to browse items. It defaults to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ob1.io&quot;&gt;OB1&lt;/a&gt;, which is underlined. OB1 is the company leading the development of OpenBazaar and we have built our own search engine to help users navigate the network. We will be walking through this search engine only in this overview. Other search engines built by third parties may also be integrated &amp;amp; some may be available here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below that is the search bar where you can search for &lt;strong&gt;keywords&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;terms&lt;/strong&gt; you may want to see like &lt;strong&gt;shirt&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;art&lt;/strong&gt;. This search pulls from the keyword tags that sellers add to their listings and not the titles, descriptions or store names at this time. For best results sellers are encouraged to add all the relevant tags they can think of to help buyers find their items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also choose from the Suggestions just below the search bar to browse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below the search bar on the left side are different criteria you can use to help search &amp;amp; sort listings to your preferences. By default the Accepted Currency will match the currency you selected for your wallet on setup so it’s easier to see items available that you can pay for using your OpenBazaar wallet. You are able to change this setting to browse other items available but you will not be able to pay for them unless you set up an additional wallet supporting that currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;make-a-purchase&quot;&gt;Make a purchase&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find something you’d like to purchase, click &lt;strong&gt;BUY NOW&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The order process is a 4 (sometimes 5) step process that begins when you click &lt;strong&gt;BUY NOW&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;OpenBazaar Order Process.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Order Process&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar Order Process&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This initiates the purchase channel that you then can choose to &lt;strong&gt;Fund&lt;/strong&gt; by sending your coins. If you simply click Buy and do not Fund a purchase, no coins are transferred and it functionally becomes a cancelled order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next phases of the purchase may include &lt;strong&gt;Accepted&lt;/strong&gt; then will always have &lt;strong&gt;Fulfilled&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Complete&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;Accepted&lt;/strong&gt; action must be completed by the seller to open the payment connection if required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the seller sends your order they will then set the status to &lt;strong&gt;Fulfilled&lt;/strong&gt;. Then you must Complete the order and leave a review when your purchase has been completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;payment-types-in-openbazaar&quot;&gt;Payment Types in OpenBazaar&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three types of payments in OpenBazaar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct payments&lt;/strong&gt; - Coins are sent directly from the buyer to the seller.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderated payments&lt;/strong&gt; - Coins are sent to a 2-of-3 multisignature account that works like escrow. A third party moderator, who is another regular user type within OpenBazaar, is added to this kind of transaction to help in case of a dispute.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offline payments&lt;/strong&gt; - when a seller is offline, coins are sent to a 1-of-2 multisig address that they can accept when they return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read more about how the different payment types work &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000303371-What-are-the-different-payment-types-in-OpenBazaar-&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wallets&quot;&gt;Wallets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use an external cryptocurrency wallet to pay for listings or use the &lt;strong&gt;integrated wallet&lt;/strong&gt; by sending funds to it first. Click &lt;strong&gt;Receive Money&lt;/strong&gt; and either send coins from a mobile wallet using the QR code or copy and paste the text address below into your your desktop wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;setting-up-additional-coin-type-wallets&quot;&gt;Setting Up Additional Coin Type Wallets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you find something that you would like to buy but that requires a different type of cryptocurrency wallet than your node has? At this time additional wallets can be added by creating additional nodes you can easily toggle between on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply hover over your avatar in the top right corner and then your store name. Click the option &lt;strong&gt;New Server&lt;/strong&gt;. This will take you to a module where you can select the new type of node you’d like to set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After setup, you can then quickly toggle between your nodes by doing basically this same thing again: hovering over your avatar, then your store name, then selecting your additional nodes from the menu that pops up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chat log:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:13 chris.troutner: Would love an update on the user metrics and if that’s been giving OB1 good feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:14 mg (OB1): Heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:18 chris.troutner: Thanks Sam&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:21 Matt: Sorry I missed that, who is when in Berlin? (since I would like to meet up there)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:21 Matt: ahh ok&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:23 chris.troutner: ‘Wallet developers’ &amp;lt;– I like that. One you guys come out with the new multicurrency wallet, I’m going to want to create a plugin for my ERC20 token.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:24 crasch: Is anyone working on porting Monero to work with OB?  I know it’s often difficult to incorporate due it’s non-BTC derived code base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:24 chris.troutner: Very appriciated! I love the uptick on blog posts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:26 Daniel: Does zcash still require you to run a node?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:26 crasch: * nods *   Thanks for the update re: Monero, plugin architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:27 Daniel: Ok&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:28 Daniel: Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:28 chris.troutner: Not sure if you guys want to go down that rabbit hole, but I’m very excited at the prospect of OB working with arbitrary tokens, be they ERC20 or soon-to-be colored coins on the BCH network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:30 chris.troutner: Ya, Chris Pacia on on the forefront of that. BCH colored coins are not nailed down yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:30 Daniel: Would these tokens be used for payments only? Or something else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:31 Daniel: Ok thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:32 crasch: Have there been any changes to your roadmap that was published 3 months ago?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:35 Daniel: What do you see when you go to openbazaar.com?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:36 Daniel: Oh, it wasn’t resolving the URL for a while&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:36 Daniel: it’s working now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:37 Daniel: yes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:37 crasch: Where do you think community members who wanted to contribute to documentation could best help?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:37 Daniel: are you targeting specific communities yet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:37 Daniel: for example, people that play magic the gathering&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:38 Daniel: i.e. getting OpenBazaar popular within a single community (maybe a non-crypto related community) to find out the blocks to adoption&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:38 Daniel: or do you only expect people to use OpenBazaar if they already hold crypto?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:39 crasch: Thanks for the info:  re: doc channel on Slack, mg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:39 chris.troutner: Ya, for those interested, just type #documentation_2-0 in slack to join the channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:40 mg (OB1): Thanks Chris&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:41 crasch: What would be your pitch to use OB1 for crypto trading vs say, bisq?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:41 Daniel: Ok, so only people that hold crypto so far. Makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month I had the opportunity to attend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ipfs/conf&quot;&gt;IPFS/Libp2p Developer Meeting&lt;/a&gt; in Berlin. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipfs.io/&quot;&gt;IPFS&lt;/a&gt; development is of great importance to us as OpenBazaar is built on top of it and relies heavily on it for most of its functionality. Overall the meeting was very productive. It was nice to meet the new members of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://protocol.ai/&quot;&gt;Protocol Labs&lt;/a&gt; team and see how they are growing. They have an enormous amount of talent on their team and in the IPFS community and they’re genuinely solving very hard problems in decentralized web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;IPFS and Libp2p Developer Meetings in Berlin 2018.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IPFS and Libp2p Developer Meetings in Berlin 2018&quot; title=&quot;IPFS and Libp2p Developer Meetings in Berlin 2018&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are some of the key takeaways from this event as they relate directly to OpenBazaar:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quic&quot;&gt;QUIC&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve been able to integrate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromium.org/quic&quot;&gt;QUIC&lt;/a&gt; as a transport for IPFS. For those who don’t what QUIC is, it’s a new transport created by Google which offers all around better performance than TCP. Not only will QUIC make OpenBazaar faster, but it will help slightly with NAT traversal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ipns-pubsub&quot;&gt;IPNS Pubsub&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pubsub isn’t yet hooked up in the IPFS coreapi package but will be shortly. While we will still need to make a DHT crawl the first time an IPNS query is made as well as when coming back from absence, all subsequent queries will return the most up-to-date record instantly. We should see a nice speed boost in browsing as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;IPFS and Libp2p Developer Meetings in Berlin 2018-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IPFS and Libp2p Developer Meetings in Berlin 2018 - Presentation&quot; title=&quot;IPFS and Libp2p Developer Meetings in Berlin 2018 - Presentation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nat-traversal&quot;&gt;NAT Traversal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that IPFS is already doing more for NAT traversal than I realized but more work is still needed. Currently a high percentage of nodes on the IPFS network are not reachable and I presume it’s probably a similar percentage of OpenBazaar nodes. We had some nice discussion about improving NAT traversal. The first action item is to wire up the libp2p-autonat package which will help detect if users are behind restricted NATs. Moving forward we’d like to develop some heuristics for deciding if and how to relay packets through other nodes using the libp2p-circuit-relay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-onion-transport&quot;&gt;New onion-transport&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve done some preliminary work on a new onion transport for libp2p. Our current transport was written by me and will at minimum need to be changed to conform to planned changes to the transport interface. I believe the goal, however, will be to have the new transport ready by the time that new interface goes live so we can easily make the switch. There’s also a possibility we can use a library which statically compiles the Tor daemon and maybe resolve some issues running OpenBazaar on Tails and Whonix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was plenty more talked about and presented, some of which will likely be in OpenBazaar under the hood but also plenty of projects that are genuinely interesting in the own right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll look forward to seeing everyone again for IPFS conference in Lisbon in November.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">By OB1 Lead Backend Developer Chris Pacia</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">New OpenBazaar Release Enables Trading 1500+ Cryptocurrencies</title><link href="https://openbazaar.org/blog/New-OpenBazaar-Release-Enables-Trading-1500-Cryptocurrencies/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New OpenBazaar Release Enables &lt;span class='post-title-extra'&gt;Trading 1500+ Cryptocurrencies&lt;/span&gt;" /><published>2018-07-27T14:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-07-27T14:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://openbazaar.org/blog/New-OpenBazaar-Release-Enables-Trading-1500-Cryptocurrencies</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://openbazaar.org/blog/New-OpenBazaar-Release-Enables-Trading-1500-Cryptocurrencies/">&lt;p&gt;OpenBazaar &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-desktop/releases/tag/v2.2.2&quot;&gt;version 2.2.2&lt;/a&gt; was just released, and this update gives users several new improvements to the cryptocurrency trading feature. This release also includes other improvements and bug fixes; for full details read the release notes posted below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cryptocurrency-trading&quot;&gt;Cryptocurrency trading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release includes two major improvements to the cryptocurrency trading feature within OpenBazaar.
The first is the ability for users offering to trade coins to mark up or discount their price. Instead of only being able to offer a trade at market price, they can choose to add a markup, which will automatically increase the price to the buyer based on the percentage they choose. They can also choose to offer a discount from market price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software constantly is updating the market price of the cryptocurrencies involved in the trade, and will add the markup or discount at the moment the trade happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Cryptocurrency Listing Type Price Modifier.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Setting a markup or discount on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Setting a markup or discount on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second improvement to cryptocurrency listings is a major expansion of how many coins can be bought and sold on the platform. Previously there were about 60 available. Now we’re integrated price data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/&quot;&gt;CoinMarketCap&lt;/a&gt; and there are more than 1,500 coins you can trade on OpenBazaar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to see if a specific coin is available, &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/download&quot;&gt;download OpenBazaar&lt;/a&gt; and start the process of creating a cryptocurrency listing. You’ll see the full list of coins in this dropdown menu:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Cryptocurrency Listing Type Chose from Over 1500 Coins.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Choosing from over 1500 cryptocurrencies&quot; title=&quot;Choosing from over 1,500 cryptocurrencies&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, there are no fees to pay and no accounts to sign up for. It’s a direct swap of cryptocurrencies between you and the other party, and if you choose a moderated payment (highly recommended) then there’s a third party available in case of dispute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to buy or sell coins without fees or without signing up for an account, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openbazaar.org/download/&quot;&gt;give OpenBazaar a try&lt;/a&gt; and let us know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;release-notes&quot;&gt;Release Notes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a minor release, focused on adding improvements to cryptocurrency listings, such as the ability to set their price above or below the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-features&quot;&gt;New Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ability to adjust the price of a cryptocurrency listing by a percentage relative to the market is now available. #1416, #1438&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A view on web feature was added to several screens. This provides a link to the same data on openbazaar.com. #1403, #1413, #1430, #1441&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;improvements&quot;&gt;Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The name of each address in the settings modal is now bold. #1459&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The order of the items in the nav menu was adjusted, and your name is now clickable. #1459&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New details were added to the opt-in metrics. #1440, #1446&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The trumbowyg text editor will now be translated if it has the required language files. #1436&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moderators that don’t use the same cryptocurrency as the user cannot be added as a moderator. If they were already added, they will be marked as invalid so they can be removed. #1420&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Non-translated text is now translated. #1392, #1382, #1435&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When a cryptocurrency order is fulfilled, the tx sent by the seller can be clicked if it is a URL. If HTML is included in the data, the HTML is removed. The data is validated to not be more than 512 characters. #1386, #1396, #1397&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A script to download and implement new cryptocurrency data for cryptocurrency listings was implemented. This is run manually before each release. #1384, #1422, #1423, #1429, #1479&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bug-fixes&quot;&gt;Bug Fixes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A rare problem where the debug log can have an error has been corrected. #1480&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new node will now have a default value of 0 for their reviews instead of showing an error. #1477&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A bug preventing a user from looking at their own moderator details modal has been fixed. #1473&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The memo in a purchase will no longer be cleared on a screen rerender. #1467&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When an order times out, but has not been fulfilled, when the seller claims the payment the buyer will no longer be told they can complete the order. #1463&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A potential race condition in the order details screen was corrected. #1452&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some minor issues with disputes when only one party’s contract has been received by the moderator were cleaned up. #1448&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BCH QR codes will not always have the proper prefix. #1418&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A problem with the shipping option selection resetting when interacting with the purchase page was corrected. #1402, #1442, #1447&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An issue with the free shipping tag not being horizontally aligned in the store screen was fixed. #1385&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

That freedom implies choice: the right to choose who to trade with, to choose how to protect your purchase, or to choose the visibility of your listings. That freedom should also extend to your choice of currency. And more than that! For your choice to be independent of any one developer’s motives, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://ob1.io&quot;&gt;OB1&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first of two posts which share the motivation and direction our team will take as we explore how to make OpenBazaar work with any currency users choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-the-wallet&quot;&gt;Why The Wallet?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right around the time &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/openbazaar-20-is-live/&quot;&gt;OpenBazaar 2.0 launched&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; – the default payment option of OpenBazaar at the time – was experiencing high transaction volume lasting several months resulting in network congestion and a poor user experience. All of this created significant friction during a small window where many first impressions would be established. With the landscape of growing alternative cryptocurrencies simultaneously booming around Bitcoin’s shortcomings, it punctuated the need for a choice in payment inside OpenBazaar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seeking-currency-nirvana&quot;&gt;Seeking Currency Nirvana&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making OpenBazaar capable of trading with multiple simultaneous currencies affects many aspects of the application: the &lt;strong&gt;Seller&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Moderator&lt;/strong&gt; both have concerns for the types of currencies they can accept on the network; the &lt;strong&gt;Buyer&lt;/strong&gt; has concerns in the refund scenarios; the &lt;strong&gt;Wallet&lt;/strong&gt; implementation manipulates the state of the ledger with the current currency’s representation in mind; there are concerns for the protocol in how certain listings shall be validated; and many screens of interface which need to be reconsidered. With lot of ground to cover, we needed a solution in user’s hands with the least development effort required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A solution was devised that many wallet implementations (along with their respective currency’s representations) would be provided along with the application and the user would be able to select one on startup. The additional options for currency usage would include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bitcoincash.org/&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Cash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://z.cash&quot;&gt;Zcash&lt;/a&gt; and would make the application’s active currency interchangeable while touching very few of the related details. A seamless experience for the user with just a restart between each currency in use. Only a few screens in the interface would need a change to represent the currently active currency. The server would allow each configuration to be maintained side-by-side facilitating the simple switching from one currency to another without needing to break any of the previously made design decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2018, OB1 released &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/openbazaar-21-released-bitcoin-cash-and-zcash-integrated/&quot;&gt;version 2.1&lt;/a&gt;. This release was a half-step which allowed our team to quickly respond to the unexpected market conditions, but it also created many new challenges. The release proved that the option of other currencies were welcome and being requested on the network. At the time of publishing this article, 12% of crawlable listings have selected Bitcoin Cash as the accepted currency. But it also educated us on the limitations of adopting third-party wallets as we attempted to support multiple contributions; each presenting their own technical and social challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Setting-Up-a-New-Server-Node-Wallet-on-OpenBazaar-1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Setting Up a New Server Node Wallet on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Setting Up a New Server Node Wallet on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the OpenBazaar wallet was designed, we assumed quite a few time-saving details. The biggest of these assumptions was that Bitcoin would be the only currency in use. This, of course, had side-effects in our design such as a ledger which only tracks UTXO-based currencies as well as displaying values in other currencies from values represented in Bitcoin. We also made the assumption that users would prefer wallets which could independently verify their own transactions as a matter of ensuring the user need not trust the protocol or even the UI. As such, our wallet implementations default to using &lt;strong&gt;Simple Payment Verification (SPV)&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure the user’s own transactions are highly unlikely to be invalid with the option for users to operate full Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash nodes if they preferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these design decisions needed reconsideration. The maturing mobile experience which the OB1 team was exploring in the background needed a better solution and the existing 2.0 desktop experience was certainly ready to see a simpler interface when using multiple currencies. The existing answer would have lead toward running an SPV wallet (or full node) for each currency simultaneously, but would not scale in resource-constrained environments such as mobile and older-generation computers. OB1 is also integrating Ethereum as a currency for trade on the network and this has highlighted limitations in our UTXO-based ledger and wallet interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;formalizing-the-multiwallet&quot;&gt;Formalizing the Multiwallet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needing to make a decision with some urgency, internal discussion landed us on a solution in pursuit of an API backend driving interactions on the blockchain. Each API would handle the concerns for handling their respective currency’s blockchain which would reduce the responsibility of the OB1 team in maintaining currency-specific logic. Users would no longer need to provide the computing resources for transacting on the currency’s blockchain at the expense of the API operator (currently OB1, but more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The APIs of the existing currencies that we already support abstract nicely into our existing wallet-interface with a minor change of adding an additional dimension to a few of the requests (so the wallet knows to which currency’s blockchain a transaction should be applied). With only very minor technical concerns that seemed solvable, the biggest obstacle was that we were sacrificing the user’s default expectation that they can trustlessly engage with their built-in wallet without any other alternatives. Still an imperfect solution for the security-conscious, but a good next step toward supporting multiple simultaneous currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;openbazaar-multiwallet-design.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Multi Wallet Design&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar Multi Wallet Design&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expect that different use cases will change the user’s expectations of the wallet. For example, a vendor might care more about the verifiability of their transactions than a buyer, and a mobile user may prefer to utilize an API-based wallet to save on limited device resources. It would be difficult to build the ideal wallet for all of our users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the OB1 team is committed to seeing OpenBazaar as a protocol of trade which is agnostic of the currency it uses for trade. Any time invested into wallet maintenance is only distracting us from our goals. This was made painfully obvious by the questions raised when the third-party wallet contributions began rolling in. It was unclear who would provide a fix when a bug compromises funds in a user’s wallet. Or decide when a wallet implementation was valuable enough to offer as an option. Nor did we want to be the ones conjuring arbitrary rules for approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the obvious question was asked: How could we offer the choice of currency and wallet directly to the user? More on that in an upcoming post!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">OpenBazaar is the most free marketplace available on the planet.
