We’ve had an excellent season so far with the release of some new features and seeing a pop of new users come in. We want to keep the fun going just a little bit longer by &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com/bitcoin-promotion&quot;&gt;giving away some bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;here-are-a-few-things-we-are-proud-of-accomplishing-this-summer&quot;&gt;Here are a few things we are proud of accomplishing this summer:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launched&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/New-OpenBazaar-Release-Enables-Trading-1500-Cryptocurrencies/&quot;&gt;peer-to-peer trading over 1,500 cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt; with seller’s choice of adding a markup or discount&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Built&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com&quot;&gt;a whole new website&lt;/a&gt; just for browsing OpenBazaar on the web&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcomed&lt;/strong&gt; thousands of new users from over 125 different countries into the OpenBazaar network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited to see people trading cryptocurrencies and easily sharing their stores and listings on social media. Very soon they will also be able to make and take payments in &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; wallet with their choice of &lt;strong&gt;five&lt;/strong&gt; different coins!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are constantly working to make decentralized ecommerce extremely beautiful and accessible for everyone, everywhere on earth. And we couldn’t do it without people from so many different places developing, trading and participating right alongside us, telling us what they think and helping us make this thing better every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want you to try it and tell us about it, too. To sweeten the already awesome deal of checking out the future of ecommerce, we want to give you &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com/bitcoin-promotion&quot;&gt;$10 BTC toward your first purchase on OpenBazaar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com/bitcoin-promotion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Get $10 Bitcoin for OpenBazaar.png&quot; alt=&quot;How To Get $10 in BTC for Your First Purchase on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;How To Get $10 in BTC for Your First Purchase on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, we’re just &lt;em&gt;giving away $10 in bitcoin&lt;/em&gt; so you can try OpenBazaar for yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we aren’t even being creepy about it. You don’t need to already have or send bitcoin to anybody else nor spam everyone you’ve ever met. You just need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com/bitcoin-promotion&quot;&gt;follow these short instructions&lt;/a&gt; and we will send $10 BTC to your OpenBazaar wallet so you can shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all we have for now. Grab your &lt;strong&gt;free bitcoin&lt;/strong&gt; and we’ll see you in the marketplace!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">For those of us in the northern hemisphere, summer is waning - and we miss it already.

We’re glad you want to buy goods, services and cryptocurrency on OpenBazaar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can start by casually browsing what’s available in this decentralized marketplace at &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.com&quot;&gt;openbazaar.com&lt;/a&gt;. When you’re ready to buy, this handy guide will show you how you can set up an OpenBazaar profile, step by step. It only takes a few minutes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any difficulties along the way, please visit our &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/support&quot;&gt;Support&lt;/a&gt; page for ways to get in touch with us and let us know. If you want to chat with someone from the OpenBazaar community for help, or to give feedback on how OpenBazaar is working for you, join our &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/slack&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1--download-and-install-openbazaar&quot;&gt;Step 1 – Download and Install OpenBazaar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most users will want to download the package that matches their operating system from our website at &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/download&quot;&gt;openbazaar.org/download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have some technical expertise and want to manually install OpenBazaar, read &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-go/tree/master/docs/&quot;&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2--run-openbazaar&quot;&gt;Step 2 – Run OpenBazaar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time you run OpenBazaar you will be guided through a short &lt;strong&gt;onboarding process&lt;/strong&gt; to setup and personalize your &lt;strong&gt;node&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your OpenBazaar &lt;strong&gt;node&lt;/strong&gt; is similar to an account or profile on a traditional website but with an important difference: &lt;em&gt;you own it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With websites, you create your user account on a server that someone else, like Amazon or Ebay, owns entirely. This is kind of like renting an apartment in a building that they own. When you are “leasing” space on a regular website this way, they control how you access it, too. They give you “keys” that you use to access your account–your login and password–and they can also revoke them at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With OpenBazaar, you create and own &lt;strong&gt;your own server&lt;/strong&gt;–your &lt;strong&gt;node!&lt;/strong&gt;–that participates in the marketplace network, and all data you create lives on &lt;strong&gt;your own computer&lt;/strong&gt;. This is like building your own independent house that has a private entrance only you can find so no login or password are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since your node and profile live entirely on your own computer, someone would have to access your computer directly in order to make changes to it or take it down. This is more secure than how websites operate though it requires a little bit more knowledge to manage. For example, if you want to access your profile from another computer, you have to move all of your files to that other computer. To “close” your account, you simply &lt;strong&gt;delete your files from your computer&lt;/strong&gt; following &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012910151&quot;&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are working to make this more flexible in the future so that you have the option to set up your profile or store to be accessible from various devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;onboarding-setup&quot;&gt;Onboarding Setup&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Get Started.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Get Started&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Get Started&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you go! Time to Get Started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Cryptocurrency Wallet Setup.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Cryptocurrency Wallet Setup&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Cryptocurrency Wallet Setup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First you will be asked to set up your integrated cryptocurrency wallet. Right now this includes Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Zcash (beta). At this time you can only select one to start but if you would like the option to shop with more of the available currencies you can add additional wallets after this first setup which is described later in this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Add Your Info.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Add Your Info&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Add Your Info&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you will be asked a few questions such as your name, description of your profile/store, country, and preferred display currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also have the opportunity to upload an avatar for your profile. Click on &lt;strong&gt;Select Avatar&lt;/strong&gt; to choose a file from your computer. Recommendations here are to choose a nice, uncomplicated avatar that scales well into a circle frame as it will appear around the application. Avatars should be a square at least 280px by 280px or larger for best visual appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Terms of Service.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Terms of Service&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Terms of Service&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is a disclaimer about using the OpenBazaar software, which you should read before continuing because OpenBazaar is an unique and new kind of marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Optional Opt-In Metrics.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Optional Opt-In Metrics&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Optional Opt-In Metrics&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you will see a screen asking you to opt into &lt;strong&gt;optional analytics collection&lt;/strong&gt;. This is your choice and even if you change your mind you can always opt in or out again at any time in your &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding - Your New Profile Store Page.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Your New Profile Store Page&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar Onboarding Screen - Your New Profile Store Page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing onboarding, you’ll now see your own &lt;strong&gt;OpenBazaar Store page&lt;/strong&gt;. Each user has their own profile and store on the OpenBazaar network by default but if you are just joining as a buyer you don’t need Click on &lt;strong&gt;Home&lt;/strong&gt; in the menu near the top to see your regular profile page and make changes as you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3--search--buy&quot;&gt;Step 3 – Search &amp;amp; Buy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To browse items, click the &lt;strong&gt;OpenBazaar tent icon&lt;/strong&gt; to the right of the address bar at the top of your client window to &lt;strong&gt;Discover&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;OpenBazaar Discover Screen.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Discover Screen&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar Discover Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will see the &lt;strong&gt;Discover&lt;/strong&gt; bar at the top which shows the integrated search engines you can use to browse items. It defaults to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ob1.io&quot;&gt;OB1&lt;/a&gt;, which is underlined. OB1 is the company leading the development of OpenBazaar and we have built our own search engine to help users navigate the network. We will be walking through this search engine only in this overview. Other search engines built by third parties may also be integrated &amp;amp; some may be available here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below that is the search bar where you can search for &lt;strong&gt;keywords&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;terms&lt;/strong&gt; you may want to see like &lt;strong&gt;shirt&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;art&lt;/strong&gt;. This search pulls from the keyword tags that sellers add to their listings and not the titles, descriptions or store names at this time. For best results sellers are encouraged to add all the relevant tags they can think of to help buyers find their items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also choose from the Suggestions just below the search bar to browse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below the search bar on the left side are different criteria you can use to help search &amp;amp; sort listings to your preferences. By default the Accepted Currency will match the currency you selected for your wallet on setup so it’s easier to see items available that you can pay for using your OpenBazaar wallet. You are able to change this setting to browse other items available but you will not be able to pay for them unless you set up an additional wallet supporting that currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;make-a-purchase&quot;&gt;Make a purchase&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you find something you’d like to purchase, click &lt;strong&gt;BUY NOW&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The order process is a 4 (sometimes 5) step process that begins when you click &lt;strong&gt;BUY NOW&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;OpenBazaar Order Process.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Order Process&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar Order Process&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This initiates the purchase channel that you then can choose to &lt;strong&gt;Fund&lt;/strong&gt; by sending your coins. If you simply click Buy and do not Fund a purchase, no coins are transferred and it functionally becomes a cancelled order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next phases of the purchase may include &lt;strong&gt;Accepted&lt;/strong&gt; then will always have &lt;strong&gt;Fulfilled&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Complete&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;Accepted&lt;/strong&gt; action must be completed by the seller to open the payment connection if required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the seller sends your order they will then set the status to &lt;strong&gt;Fulfilled&lt;/strong&gt;. Then you must Complete the order and leave a review when your purchase has been completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;payment-types-in-openbazaar&quot;&gt;Payment Types in OpenBazaar&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three types of payments in OpenBazaar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct payments&lt;/strong&gt; - Coins are sent directly from the buyer to the seller.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderated payments&lt;/strong&gt; - Coins are sent to a 2-of-3 multisignature account that works like escrow. A third party moderator, who is another regular user type within OpenBazaar, is added to this kind of transaction to help in case of a dispute.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Offline payments&lt;/strong&gt; - when a seller is offline, coins are sent to a 1-of-2 multisig address that they can accept when they return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read more about how the different payment types work &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000303371-What-are-the-different-payment-types-in-OpenBazaar-&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wallets&quot;&gt;Wallets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use an external cryptocurrency wallet to pay for listings or use the &lt;strong&gt;integrated wallet&lt;/strong&gt; by sending funds to it first. Click &lt;strong&gt;Receive Money&lt;/strong&gt; and either send coins from a mobile wallet using the QR code or copy and paste the text address below into your your desktop wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;setting-up-additional-coin-type-wallets&quot;&gt;Setting Up Additional Coin Type Wallets&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you find something that you would like to buy but that requires a different type of cryptocurrency wallet than your node has? At this time additional wallets can be added by creating additional nodes you can easily toggle between on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply hover over your avatar in the top right corner and then your store name. Click the option &lt;strong&gt;New Server&lt;/strong&gt;. This will take you to a module where you can select the new type of node you’d like to set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After setup, you can then quickly toggle between your nodes by doing basically this same thing again: hovering over your avatar, then your store name, then selecting your additional nodes from the menu that pops up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chat log:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:13 chris.troutner: Would love an update on the user metrics and if that’s been giving OB1 good feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:14 mg (OB1): Heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:18 chris.troutner: Thanks Sam&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:21 Matt: Sorry I missed that, who is when in Berlin? (since I would like to meet up there)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:21 Matt: ahh ok&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:23 chris.troutner: ‘Wallet developers’ &amp;lt;– I like that. One you guys come out with the new multicurrency wallet, I’m going to want to create a plugin for my ERC20 token.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:24 crasch: Is anyone working on porting Monero to work with OB?  I know it’s often difficult to incorporate due it’s non-BTC derived code base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:24 chris.troutner: Very appriciated! I love the uptick on blog posts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:26 Daniel: Does zcash still require you to run a node?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:26 crasch: * nods *   Thanks for the update re: Monero, plugin architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:27 Daniel: Ok&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:28 Daniel: Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:28 chris.troutner: Not sure if you guys want to go down that rabbit hole, but I’m very excited at the prospect of OB working with arbitrary tokens, be they ERC20 or soon-to-be colored coins on the BCH network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:30 chris.troutner: Ya, Chris Pacia on on the forefront of that. BCH colored coins are not nailed down yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:30 Daniel: Would these tokens be used for payments only? Or something else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:31 Daniel: Ok thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:32 crasch: Have there been any changes to your roadmap that was published 3 months ago?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:35 Daniel: What do you see when you go to openbazaar.com?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:36 Daniel: Oh, it wasn’t resolving the URL for a while&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:36 Daniel: it’s working now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:37 Daniel: yes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:37 crasch: Where do you think community members who wanted to contribute to documentation could best help?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:37 Daniel: are you targeting specific communities yet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:37 Daniel: for example, people that play magic the gathering&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:38 Daniel: i.e. getting OpenBazaar popular within a single community (maybe a non-crypto related community) to find out the blocks to adoption&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:38 Daniel: or do you only expect people to use OpenBazaar if they already hold crypto?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:39 crasch: Thanks for the info:  re: doc channel on Slack, mg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:39 chris.troutner: Ya, for those interested, just type #documentation_2-0 in slack to join the channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:40 mg (OB1): Thanks Chris&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:41 crasch: What would be your pitch to use OB1 for crypto trading vs say, bisq?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:41 Daniel: Ok, so only people that hold crypto so far. Makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11:45 chris.troutner: Great summary, Sam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month I had the opportunity to attend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ipfs/conf&quot;&gt;IPFS/Libp2p Developer Meeting&lt;/a&gt; in Berlin. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ipfs.io/&quot;&gt;IPFS&lt;/a&gt; development is of great importance to us as OpenBazaar is built on top of it and relies heavily on it for most of its functionality. Overall the meeting was very productive. It was nice to meet the new members of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://protocol.ai/&quot;&gt;Protocol Labs&lt;/a&gt; team and see how they are growing. They have an enormous amount of talent on their team and in the IPFS community and they’re genuinely solving very hard problems in decentralized web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;IPFS and Libp2p Developer Meetings in Berlin 2018.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IPFS and Libp2p Developer Meetings in Berlin 2018&quot; title=&quot;IPFS and Libp2p Developer Meetings in Berlin 2018&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are some of the key takeaways from this event as they relate directly to OpenBazaar:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quic&quot;&gt;QUIC&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve been able to integrate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromium.org/quic&quot;&gt;QUIC&lt;/a&gt; as a transport for IPFS. For those who don’t what QUIC is, it’s a new transport created by Google which offers all around better performance than TCP. Not only will QUIC make OpenBazaar faster, but it will help slightly with NAT traversal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ipns-pubsub&quot;&gt;IPNS Pubsub&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pubsub isn’t yet hooked up in the IPFS coreapi package but will be shortly. While we will still need to make a DHT crawl the first time an IPNS query is made as well as when coming back from absence, all subsequent queries will return the most up-to-date record instantly. We should see a nice speed boost in browsing as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;IPFS and Libp2p Developer Meetings in Berlin 2018-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IPFS and Libp2p Developer Meetings in Berlin 2018 - Presentation&quot; title=&quot;IPFS and Libp2p Developer Meetings in Berlin 2018 - Presentation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nat-traversal&quot;&gt;NAT Traversal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that IPFS is already doing more for NAT traversal than I realized but more work is still needed. Currently a high percentage of nodes on the IPFS network are not reachable and I presume it’s probably a similar percentage of OpenBazaar nodes. We had some nice discussion about improving NAT traversal. The first action item is to wire up the libp2p-autonat package which will help detect if users are behind restricted NATs. Moving forward we’d like to develop some heuristics for deciding if and how to relay packets through other nodes using the libp2p-circuit-relay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-onion-transport&quot;&gt;New onion-transport&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve done some preliminary work on a new onion transport for libp2p. Our current transport was written by me and will at minimum need to be changed to conform to planned changes to the transport interface. I believe the goal, however, will be to have the new transport ready by the time that new interface goes live so we can easily make the switch. There’s also a possibility we can use a library which statically compiles the Tor daemon and maybe resolve some issues running OpenBazaar on Tails and Whonix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was plenty more talked about and presented, some of which will likely be in OpenBazaar under the hood but also plenty of projects that are genuinely interesting in the own right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll look forward to seeing everyone again for IPFS conference in Lisbon in November.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">By OB1 Lead Backend Developer Chris Pacia</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">New OpenBazaar Release Enables Trading 1500+ Cryptocurrencies</title><link href="https://openbazaar.org/blog/New-OpenBazaar-Release-Enables-Trading-1500-Cryptocurrencies/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New OpenBazaar Release Enables &lt;span class='post-title-extra'&gt;Trading 1500+ Cryptocurrencies&lt;/span&gt;" /><published>2018-07-27T14:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-07-27T14:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://openbazaar.org/blog/New-OpenBazaar-Release-Enables-Trading-1500-Cryptocurrencies</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://openbazaar.org/blog/New-OpenBazaar-Release-Enables-Trading-1500-Cryptocurrencies/">&lt;p&gt;OpenBazaar &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-desktop/releases/tag/v2.2.2&quot;&gt;version 2.2.2&lt;/a&gt; was just released, and this update gives users several new improvements to the cryptocurrency trading feature. This release also includes other improvements and bug fixes; for full details read the release notes posted below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cryptocurrency-trading&quot;&gt;Cryptocurrency trading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release includes two major improvements to the cryptocurrency trading feature within OpenBazaar.
The first is the ability for users offering to trade coins to mark up or discount their price. Instead of only being able to offer a trade at market price, they can choose to add a markup, which will automatically increase the price to the buyer based on the percentage they choose. They can also choose to offer a discount from market price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software constantly is updating the market price of the cryptocurrencies involved in the trade, and will add the markup or discount at the moment the trade happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Cryptocurrency Listing Type Price Modifier.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Setting a markup or discount on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Setting a markup or discount on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second improvement to cryptocurrency listings is a major expansion of how many coins can be bought and sold on the platform. Previously there were about 60 available. Now we’re integrated price data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/&quot;&gt;CoinMarketCap&lt;/a&gt; and there are more than 1,500 coins you can trade on OpenBazaar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to see if a specific coin is available, &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/download&quot;&gt;download OpenBazaar&lt;/a&gt; and start the process of creating a cryptocurrency listing. You’ll see the full list of coins in this dropdown menu:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Cryptocurrency Listing Type Chose from Over 1500 Coins.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Choosing from over 1500 cryptocurrencies&quot; title=&quot;Choosing from over 1,500 cryptocurrencies&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, there are no fees to pay and no accounts to sign up for. It’s a direct swap of cryptocurrencies between you and the other party, and if you choose a moderated payment (highly recommended) then there’s a third party available in case of dispute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to buy or sell coins without fees or without signing up for an account, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openbazaar.org/download/&quot;&gt;give OpenBazaar a try&lt;/a&gt; and let us know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;release-notes&quot;&gt;Release Notes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a minor release, focused on adding improvements to cryptocurrency listings, such as the ability to set their price above or below the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-features&quot;&gt;New Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ability to adjust the price of a cryptocurrency listing by a percentage relative to the market is now available. #1416, #1438&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A view on web feature was added to several screens. This provides a link to the same data on openbazaar.com. #1403, #1413, #1430, #1441&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;improvements&quot;&gt;Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The name of each address in the settings modal is now bold. #1459&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The order of the items in the nav menu was adjusted, and your name is now clickable. #1459&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New details were added to the opt-in metrics. #1440, #1446&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The trumbowyg text editor will now be translated if it has the required language files. #1436&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moderators that don’t use the same cryptocurrency as the user cannot be added as a moderator. If they were already added, they will be marked as invalid so they can be removed. #1420&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Non-translated text is now translated. #1392, #1382, #1435&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When a cryptocurrency order is fulfilled, the tx sent by the seller can be clicked if it is a URL. If HTML is included in the data, the HTML is removed. The data is validated to not be more than 512 characters. #1386, #1396, #1397&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A script to download and implement new cryptocurrency data for cryptocurrency listings was implemented. This is run manually before each release. #1384, #1422, #1423, #1429, #1479&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bug-fixes&quot;&gt;Bug Fixes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A rare problem where the debug log can have an error has been corrected. #1480&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new node will now have a default value of 0 for their reviews instead of showing an error. #1477&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A bug preventing a user from looking at their own moderator details modal has been fixed. #1473&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The memo in a purchase will no longer be cleared on a screen rerender. #1467&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When an order times out, but has not been fulfilled, when the seller claims the payment the buyer will no longer be told they can complete the order. #1463&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A potential race condition in the order details screen was corrected. #1452&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some minor issues with disputes when only one party’s contract has been received by the moderator were cleaned up. #1448&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BCH QR codes will not always have the proper prefix. #1418&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A problem with the shipping option selection resetting when interacting with the purchase page was corrected. #1402, #1442, #1447&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An issue with the free shipping tag not being horizontally aligned in the store screen was fixed. #1385&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

That freedom implies choice: the right to choose who to trade with, to choose how to protect your purchase, or to choose the visibility of your listings. That freedom should also extend to your choice of currency. And more than that! For your choice to be independent of any one developer’s motives, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://ob1.io&quot;&gt;OB1&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first of two posts which share the motivation and direction our team will take as we explore how to make OpenBazaar work with any currency users choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-the-wallet&quot;&gt;Why The Wallet?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right around the time &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/openbazaar-20-is-live/&quot;&gt;OpenBazaar 2.0 launched&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; – the default payment option of OpenBazaar at the time – was experiencing high transaction volume lasting several months resulting in network congestion and a poor user experience. All of this created significant friction during a small window where many first impressions would be established. With the landscape of growing alternative cryptocurrencies simultaneously booming around Bitcoin’s shortcomings, it punctuated the need for a choice in payment inside OpenBazaar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seeking-currency-nirvana&quot;&gt;Seeking Currency Nirvana&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making OpenBazaar capable of trading with multiple simultaneous currencies affects many aspects of the application: the &lt;strong&gt;Seller&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Moderator&lt;/strong&gt; both have concerns for the types of currencies they can accept on the network; the &lt;strong&gt;Buyer&lt;/strong&gt; has concerns in the refund scenarios; the &lt;strong&gt;Wallet&lt;/strong&gt; implementation manipulates the state of the ledger with the current currency’s representation in mind; there are concerns for the protocol in how certain listings shall be validated; and many screens of interface which need to be reconsidered. With lot of ground to cover, we needed a solution in user’s hands with the least development effort required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A solution was devised that many wallet implementations (along with their respective currency’s representations) would be provided along with the application and the user would be able to select one on startup. The additional options for currency usage would include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bitcoincash.org/&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Cash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://z.cash&quot;&gt;Zcash&lt;/a&gt; and would make the application’s active currency interchangeable while touching very few of the related details. A seamless experience for the user with just a restart between each currency in use. Only a few screens in the interface would need a change to represent the currently active currency. The server would allow each configuration to be maintained side-by-side facilitating the simple switching from one currency to another without needing to break any of the previously made design decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2018, OB1 released &lt;a href=&quot;https://openbazaar.org/blog/openbazaar-21-released-bitcoin-cash-and-zcash-integrated/&quot;&gt;version 2.1&lt;/a&gt;. This release was a half-step which allowed our team to quickly respond to the unexpected market conditions, but it also created many new challenges. The release proved that the option of other currencies were welcome and being requested on the network. At the time of publishing this article, 12% of crawlable listings have selected Bitcoin Cash as the accepted currency. But it also educated us on the limitations of adopting third-party wallets as we attempted to support multiple contributions; each presenting their own technical and social challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Setting-Up-a-New-Server-Node-Wallet-on-OpenBazaar-1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Setting Up a New Server Node Wallet on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Setting Up a New Server Node Wallet on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the OpenBazaar wallet was designed, we assumed quite a few time-saving details. The biggest of these assumptions was that Bitcoin would be the only currency in use. This, of course, had side-effects in our design such as a ledger which only tracks UTXO-based currencies as well as displaying values in other currencies from values represented in Bitcoin. We also made the assumption that users would prefer wallets which could independently verify their own transactions as a matter of ensuring the user need not trust the protocol or even the UI. As such, our wallet implementations default to using &lt;strong&gt;Simple Payment Verification (SPV)&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure the user’s own transactions are highly unlikely to be invalid with the option for users to operate full Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash nodes if they preferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these design decisions needed reconsideration. The maturing mobile experience which the OB1 team was exploring in the background needed a better solution and the existing 2.0 desktop experience was certainly ready to see a simpler interface when using multiple currencies. The existing answer would have lead toward running an SPV wallet (or full node) for each currency simultaneously, but would not scale in resource-constrained environments such as mobile and older-generation computers. OB1 is also integrating Ethereum as a currency for trade on the network and this has highlighted limitations in our UTXO-based ledger and wallet interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;formalizing-the-multiwallet&quot;&gt;Formalizing the Multiwallet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needing to make a decision with some urgency, internal discussion landed us on a solution in pursuit of an API backend driving interactions on the blockchain. Each API would handle the concerns for handling their respective currency’s blockchain which would reduce the responsibility of the OB1 team in maintaining currency-specific logic. Users would no longer need to provide the computing resources for transacting on the currency’s blockchain at the expense of the API operator (currently OB1, but more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The APIs of the existing currencies that we already support abstract nicely into our existing wallet-interface with a minor change of adding an additional dimension to a few of the requests (so the wallet knows to which currency’s blockchain a transaction should be applied). With only very minor technical concerns that seemed solvable, the biggest obstacle was that we were sacrificing the user’s default expectation that they can trustlessly engage with their built-in wallet without any other alternatives. Still an imperfect solution for the security-conscious, but a good next step toward supporting multiple simultaneous currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;openbazaar-multiwallet-design.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Multi Wallet Design&quot; title=&quot;OpenBazaar Multi Wallet Design&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expect that different use cases will change the user’s expectations of the wallet. For example, a vendor might care more about the verifiability of their transactions than a buyer, and a mobile user may prefer to utilize an API-based wallet to save on limited device resources. It would be difficult to build the ideal wallet for all of our users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the OB1 team is committed to seeing OpenBazaar as a protocol of trade which is agnostic of the currency it uses for trade. Any time invested into wallet maintenance is only distracting us from our goals. This was made painfully obvious by the questions raised when the third-party wallet contributions began rolling in. It was unclear who would provide a fix when a bug compromises funds in a user’s wallet. Or decide when a wallet implementation was valuable enough to offer as an option. Nor did we want to be the ones conjuring arbitrary rules for approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the obvious question was asked: How could we offer the choice of currency and wallet directly to the user? More on that in an upcoming post!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">OpenBazaar is the most free marketplace available on the planet.

I was able to attend and wanted to briefly give my own recap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zcash is one of the three cryptocurrencies that are currently accepted inside OpenBazaar. Their focus on financial privacy aligns with the goals of OpenBazaar as a platform where people can choose how private they want their transactions to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Zcash Foundation is a relatively young organization, formed to take a leadership role in the Zcash community which has primarily been guided by the Zcash Company. OpenBazaar and OB1 are in a similar situation, where the OB1 company has been leading development on OpenBazaar for years, and we’re now looking to create an OpenBazaar Foundation to move stewardship of the project into a more community-focused nonprofit organization. Part of my interest in attending Zcon0 was to see a community going through an organizational change and see what issues presented themselves and what I could learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first trip to Montreal. Everyone says it’s a beautiful city, and they’re right. I arrived the day before the conference and visited Mont Royal, a large hill with a park and a stunning view of the city. My phone’s camera doesn’t quite do it justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;montroyal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mont Royal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-1&quot;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The director of the Foundation, Josh Cincinnati, was unable to attend for family reasons, but he kicked off the conference with a humorous and thoughtful pre-recorded message (and several of these were presented throughout the conference) welcoming us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zooko spoke next, discussing the general state of Zcash and the company, as well as diving into financial details. I was surprised at how open he was with these details. It set the tone of being honest and open with each other about how things really stood in the Zcash community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other speakers gave a history of how Zcash came to exist, and then discussed where it was going, with special emphasis on the next big update (named Sapling) coming in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most valuable presentation that morning was “Using Zcash” by Linda Naeun Lee. She was tasked with trying to buy things with Zcash and reporting on her experience. Though she has a computer science background, she wasn’t familiar with the world of cryptocurrency, and she found it a very confusing experience. Zcash simply doesn’t have good wallets, nor does it have good places to spend the coins either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Linda did take some time to explain one positive experience she had spending Zcash: on OpenBazaar! She explained how she used OpenBazaar to buy a tshirt for someone in Venezuela with Zcash. I was glad to see OpenBazaar working for its intended purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The afternoon was workshops. We got to choose which workshops we attended, and I chose ones on improving user experience and how to achieve wallet scalability. I was able to contribute some thoughts on the UX discussion based on my experience with OpenBazaar, but mostly listened to much more technically knowledgeable people in the wallet scalability discussion. The workshops were intended for the leaders of the sessions to come away from them with new ideas or poll the groups for their opinions on specific issues; I’m not sure they achieved those goals in such a relatively short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2&quot;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second day was focused on the technical side of Zcash development. I’m not a developer, and while I’m fairly knowledgeable about how Bitcoin is designed, how distributed networks work, and with the rudimentary basics of cryptography, the majority of these presentations were beyond my grasp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ZK-SNARKS are interesting - as best I can understand them! - and I appreciated that they also had presentations from other similar efforts, such as the Coda Protocol and Bulletproofs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This day was mostly me following presentations for the first ten minutes and then losing the speakers entirely when they started discussing the math or code. Still, I got a general sense for who was working on what, and why they were doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night there was a “Gala Dinner” for attendees. Zooko and Matthew Green had an informal chat with each other on stage while the audience tossed out some conversation ideas. It was a nice idea, but the conversation was unfocused and largely consisted of off-the-cuff personal opinions instead of well-considered thoughts on issues people wanted to hear discussed. But with good food and good company everyone seemed to be having a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-3&quot;&gt;Day 3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This day was devoted to governance, the issue I was most interested in, and I’m glad they took the time to focus on it. They were looking to fill two board seats in the foundation and they explained the voting process they used and their rationale for their approach. The results of the voting were revealed, and it wasn’t only for the board seats, they also asked community members questions about direction of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few members of the group questioned whether or not this voting system was truly representative of the Zcash community as a whole. It was acknowledged that the system wasn’t ideal, but that it was better than the known alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Meltzer briefly spoke and proposed creating an investment fund from the founder’s reward. The presentation itself wasn’t particularly notable, but his idea was proposed in the Zcash forums as well, and the thread was soon locked by a Zcash company employee, creating some drama in the community over the past few weeks. It seems like most people are against changing the founder’s reward, but they also are against the Zcash Company controlling the platforms where people discuss these ideas. I believe efforts are underway to transition these forums’ moderation to the Zcash Foundation now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A speaker gave an illuminating overview of where the foundation had given out grants the year before, and where it was looking to give out grants in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The morning session ended with a panel on governance with Peter Van Valkenburgh, Jill Carlson, Zooko Wilcox, Jameson Lopp, and Vitalik Buterin. There were some disagreements on what proper governance entailed, with Jameson favoring a more anarchic position like Bitcoin. Zooko spoke of his concept of consent, which wasn’t perfectly clear to me; it sounded essentially like “take it or leave it” and everyone voting with their feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference wrapped up, and I Ieft Montreal with a better understanding of Zcash from several perspectives: historical, technical,  and communal, as well as a better idea of what they hope it can become moving forward. I was encouraged to see people thinking deeply about the differences between the company and nonprofit organizations and what roles they should be playing.&lt;/p&gt;

We did, after all, build the &lt;strong&gt;world’s first fully decentralized marketplace&lt;/strong&gt; to help cryptocurrency users find each other and buy and sell goods and services anywhere in the world using this groundbreaking new kind of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While the “currency” part of cryptocurrency is particularly important to us, there are quite a few things other you can do with this technology, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important attribute they have is how they store and move value even when not measured against things like physical items or government-controlled currencies. With OpenBazaar we’ve been working hard to help users to do more things with the cryptocurrencies they love which now includes &lt;strong&gt;trading coins&lt;/strong&gt; as well as &lt;strong&gt;buying things&lt;/strong&gt;, both completely peer-to-peer. These two particular features are distinct though and we wanted to tell you a bit more about how they work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;Setting-Up-a-New-Server-Node-Wallet-on-OpenBazaar-1.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Setting Up a New Server Node Wallet on OpenBazaar&quot; title=&quot;Setting Up a New Server Node Wallet on OpenBazaar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cryptocurrency-payments-in-openbazaar&quot;&gt;Cryptocurrency Payments in OpenBazaar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, sending and receiving payments for listings in OpenBazaar can be done with &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/&quot;&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoin.org/&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Cash&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://z.cash/&quot;&gt;Zcash&lt;/a&gt; (this integration is in Beta). These payments require that both the buyer and seller have wallets running the same coin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users can &lt;strong&gt;choose which of these 3 coins&lt;/strong&gt; they would like to run when they first set up their profile and/or store. If they would like to add additional coins they can easily set up additional profiles/stores to do so that are easy to switch between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-up-a-new-server-node-wallet-on-openbazaar&quot;&gt;Setting Up a New Server Node Wallet on OpenBazaar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also choose to add funds to their OpenBazaar wallets using any other coin they may have in an external wallet as enabled by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shapeshift.io/&quot;&gt;Shapeshift&lt;/a&gt; Shifty Button integration. The coins will change and resolve to whichever of the 3 integrated coins the wallet is set to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the development side, integrating additional coins for payments like these 3 coins are is complicated to add and maintain with the current infrastructure. OpenBazaar requires that coins have certain technical attributes to be compatible with the checkout flow, they must have their own separate wallets within OpenBazaar, and users must run separate OpenBazaar nodes in order to support them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While we’ve made it easy to set up &amp;amp; toggle between different nodes running these different coins, we know this setup is far from ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-is-it-set-up-this-way&quot;&gt;Why is it set up this way?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This setup is the result of a choice we made to bridge a gap that opened up with Bitcoin when network transaction fees jumped very high at the end of 2017. We integrated Bitcoin Cash and Zcash quickly because of their technical similarity to Bitcoin, their supportive community and the ease of their implementation just to give users a couple more payment options that could allow them to circumvent these high fees if they wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plans now are to phase the network into a more inclusive structure starting with first &lt;strong&gt;combining these 3 payment coins into just one wallet&lt;/strong&gt;. This &lt;strong&gt;multicoin wallet&lt;/strong&gt; will allow users to easily use multiple coins at once rather than in separate nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long term goal is to expand the interface allow for any individual user to easily decide and set up whatever payment coins they would like to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cryptocurrency-trading-in-openbazaar&quot;&gt;Cryptocurrency Trading in OpenBazaar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrency trading is a completely separate feature from the payment coins available in OpenBazaar. It’s enabled by a custom listing type that makes it easy for users to list and search for they coins they want to sell and buy. Users can buy and sell a variety of other coins but again, right now, they must use Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Zcash for the actual payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now OpenBazaar uses third parties to pull in token information for our cryptocurrency trading. We started with &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcoinaverage.com/&quot;&gt;BitcoinAverage&lt;/a&gt; which provides 44 different coins users can list. Soon we will also be adding &lt;a href=&quot;https://coinmarketcap.com/&quot;&gt;CoinMarketCap&lt;/a&gt;’s index which will shoot the available coins up to over 1,500. All coins available on these two platforms will also be available in OpenBazaar for trading. In the future we will also be able to add individual coins and we will soon be sharing a process for getting your coin listed if it is not already available through these providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a great idea from our Series A leading investor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.omersventures.com/&quot;&gt;OMERS Ventures&lt;/a&gt;, we hosted an OpenBazaar meetup on Wednesday night at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.art-square.ca/&quot;&gt;Art Square Gallery&lt;/a&gt; across from the Art Gallery of Ontario in the heart of downtown Toronto. We had almost 130 people register for the event and over 70 showed up and packed the space to standing room only!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;OB1 CEO Brian Hoffman and Toronto Crypto Community.png&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBazaar Meetup - June 6 2018 - Toronto&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian presented a brief history of OpenBazaar (did you know that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openbazaar.org/about/&quot;&gt;original codebase&lt;/a&gt; that was forked to become OpenBazaar was produced in Toronto?), shared the latest feature releases which are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openbazaar.org/blog/cryptocurrency-trading-now-available-on-openbazaar/&quot;&gt;cryptocurrency trading&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://openbazaar.com/&quot;&gt;web browsing&lt;/a&gt;, and discussed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openbazaar.org/blog/openbazaar-2018-roadmap/&quot;&gt;future plans&lt;/a&gt; for the network. There was a great question and answer session at the end, people were very interested in the governance structures of the network and our upcoming token release, about which we know we’ve been quiet, but we will have more to share very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a pro tip for when there is an OpenBazaar event near you: we gave out 3 deluxe swag bags to 3 attendees who had either bought or sold something on the marketplace so make sure you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openbazaar.org/download/&quot;&gt;check it out for yourself&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Mags for this great tweet! I had the opportunity to meet her and so many great, SMART people including but not at all limited to Ibrahim, Ana, Mike, Brad, John, OpenBazaar vendor Sanda and a couple from Brazil, Michael and Samara, who helped with the Portuguese translation of OpenBazaar. They even had a photo of the postcard I hand wrote and sent to them with their thank you t-shirts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event wouldn’t have been possible without the help of Lukas Royal and his team who located and secured an event space in record time near the OMERS office, set up the event on Meetup and established a Telegram group for community discussion. Special thanks also goes to one of our investors, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wmougayar&quot;&gt;William Mougayar&lt;/a&gt;, who shared this event with his network and created a spike of RSVPs. You all are wonderful and we thank you so much for your support and really making this event a success!&lt;/p&gt;
