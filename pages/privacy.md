Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you may choose whether or not to participate and therefore disclose this information.

We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.

 

Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the web page.

 

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline.
