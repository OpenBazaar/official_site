OpenBazaar is an open source project using the MIT license. We accept donations to help pay for expenses like conference attendance, server infrastructure, bug bounties, and merchandise for the OpenBazaar store (all proceeds go back into the project fund).

The primary developers of OpenBazaar work for the company [OB1](http://ob1.io/){:class='alternative-link'}, which has secured venture capital funding to develop the software as well as offer services to users on the network. As such, the project currently doesn’t need community funding to survive. We appreciate other contributions more highly, such as using the software and giving us feedback on what works and what doesn’t work. We also love pull requests and code review from other developers.
