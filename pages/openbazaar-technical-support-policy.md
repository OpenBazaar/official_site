#### Overview

OpenBazaar is a free, open-source network for trading goods and services directly and privately between people – using cryptocurrency – without anyone else being able to control, interfere with, or even see those transactions. It is designed this way to let people buy and sell on the internet in a way that protects their privacy, is secure, and prevents anyone else from controlling what they do.

This also includes us. The development team led by the company OB1 can (and will) fix bugs in the software itself but without direct access to the machine on which a user runs the software, no one else is able to access or alter any other individual user’s profile, store, information or transactions.

OpenBazaar is provided as-is to be used at the discretion of each user, though we are aware that not everyone may always operate in the best interest of their fellow humans. We are working hard to add tools to make it easier to identify who is likely to be a trustworthy user on the network and to help dissuade and minimize the impact of actions that may harm users.

This policy intends to outline what the OB1 company team is able to provide in terms of technical support. Users violating the following requirements will not receive support from OB1. We reserve the right to withhold support from any request without providing a reason.

#### Scope

This policy covers users seeing technical support across all OpenBazaar & OB1 discussion and/or support channels. As OpenBazaar ecosystem continues to evolve, new policies will need to be explored. The platforms used for technical support are as follows:

- [Zendesk](https://openbazaar.zendesk.com/hc/en-us)
- Doorbell (in-app reporting tool)
- [/r/OpenBazaar](https://reddit.com/r/openbazaar) subreddit
- The OpenBazaar [Slack](https://openbazaar.org/slack) group
- Email to the openbazaar.org or ob1.io domains
 
#### Prohibited Activity Types for Receiving Support

- Drug or other illicit substances
- Illicit sexual content
- Fraud, scams, impersonations, and trafficking of personal data
