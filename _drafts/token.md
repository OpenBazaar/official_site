**Token Details**
â€”
Since its release, OpenBazaar has become the largest decentralized marketplace online, offering users unparalleled privacy and freedom over their own trade. Our team is continuing the development of the platform by introducing the **OpenBazaar Token**.

 

We believe this token can provide incentives for **users, developers** and **curators** on the OpenBazaar platform.

 

There are many challenges a fully decentralized marketplace faces. One of those challenges is product discovery. Vendors on the platform have requested the ability to promote their listings in order to drive more sales, but not be reliant on a third party search provider. The OpenBazaar Token will allow for premium placement of listings in a fully decentralized manner. Premium placement for listings is the **first token utility** that will be implemented into OpenBazaar.

 

OpenBazaar will continue to expand the functionality and utility of the token and associated smart contracts into new and exciting areas.

 

As always, **there will never be platform fees** required to buy or sell on OpenBazaar. The token is never required to use the platform. Payments will still be settled in a variety of cryptocurrencies.
