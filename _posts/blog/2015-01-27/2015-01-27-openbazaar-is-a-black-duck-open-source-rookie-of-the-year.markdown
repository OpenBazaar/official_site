 Our team is exited to announce that the OpenBazaar project has been selected as one of [Black Duck's Open Source Rookies of the Year](Rookie_2014_OpenBazaar.png). Each year, Black Duck names ten new open source projects as their Rookies of the Year. Former winners include Bootstrap, Ansible, Docker, Tox, and many other amazing projects. We're honored to be acknowledged alongside such great projects as well as the other rookies this year. We'd like to thank the community for their enthusiastic support of the project, as well as the dedicated group of volunteers who maintains the project. 2014 was a great beginning to the project, but 2015 will see OpenBazaar move out of beta and into a platform that can be used for free trade online, with Bitcoin, anywhere in the world. Let's make trade free together.
