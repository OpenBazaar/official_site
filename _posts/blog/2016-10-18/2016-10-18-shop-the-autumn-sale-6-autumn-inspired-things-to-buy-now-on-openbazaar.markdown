Up in the northern hemisphere the long summer days are getting shorter and shorter. The leaves are turning and beginning to fall from the trees and the air smells like the coming cold – and we are so ready! There's a lot to love about autumn and we wanted to highlight a few things from [OpenBazaar](http://openbazaar.org) shops to help you get in the spirit. Many of these items are offered at **a special 10% discount through October** as well -- and a few shops even have their entire inventory on sale so make sure you click through and check them out this month while it lasts. _There's a lot more to this Autumn Sale than just these autumn items though, check out the tag #AutumnSale in OpenBazaar through October to see all the new merchandise being added!_
