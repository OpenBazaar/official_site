Selling things is about way more than just moving physical products. People also make entire careers—and often very high level careers!—out of selling services they perform. These can be things done from anywhere in the world like like web design, software development, manuscript editing or copywriting, or very local things like medical assistance, home construction, legal advisory and lawn care.

In fact, services make up [percent] of the worldwide economy.

Sell Your Services Online

OpenBazaar’s unique approach to an escrow account makes it even easier for a provider to list and bill their services. By setting up a moderated transaction a provider can be sure that their client has the funds for contract they are providing and upon successful completion of the work the funds can simply be released to the provider.

On OpenBazaar you can easily sell services for cryptocurrency. Here’s how.

#### 1. Define your service

What services do you sell? How do you usually price them? Many providers offer services by the hour or on a custom basis, but to list services for sale on OpenBazaar it’s easiest to start by “productizing” them, or structuring them to be constrained to a set cost. For example, if you provide language translation services you may create listings with different prices for 100 - 200 words translated, 300 - 500 words translated and 500 - 750 words translated.

#### 2. Create your listings

Once you have your services defined you can create listings for them on OpenBazaar. Create a new listing and under Type, select “Service.”

Give it a great title and description that relates to keywords people may use in search that will help them find it easily. Make sure to describe what a buyer will get for the cost and consider adding more information such as examples of past work or testimonials to make the offer enticing.

Include at least 1 great image that describes your service such as a photo of you providing the service or an photo of the completed service with simple text overlaid, such as “500-700 Words Translated English to Chinese.” 

Just leave the shipping option blank because you don’t need to worry about shipping! Hooray!

Tags can be added to boost the searchability of your item. Include obvious ones that relate to the item itself like “website design” or “manuscript editing,” then more as relates to broader categories it represents such as “business services” or “writing services.”

A category is to help keep your store organized. If you plan to sell both software development AND language translation services, you’d just type in the appropriate category for the appropriate listing.

Variants and inventory can likely be left blank as well. These are helpful for things like physical goods where you may offer the exact same shirt but in 3 different colors. If you have variations with your services it is generally a good approach to create separate listings for each.

With the return policy you can set this up however you’d like. You may want to say no refunds if your price point is very low or perhaps offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee with a full refund option. 

Terms & conditions can be added if you have any conditions or advisory you want to make people aware of when accessing or using your digital good.

Select the coins you’d like to receive as payment--it can be just one of them or any combination.


#### 3. Share your services from OpenBazaar.com 

OpenBazaar is a marketplace where people can browse and discover the items that you have for sale—but that’s not the only way they can find them! [OpenBazaar.com](https://openbazaar.com) exists to make it easy for you and others to share stores and listings to your social media and other communities.
