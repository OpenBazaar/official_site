Making sales is about more than just moving physical products. People also make entire careers—and often very high level careers!—out of selling the services they perform. These can be things done from anywhere in the world like like web design, software development and copywriting, or very local things like medical assistance, legal representation and lawn care.

In fact, [services make up almost 70% of value added to the world's economy](https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/economy/issues-by-the-numbers/trade-in-services-economy-growth.html). This kind of market share shows an enormous opportunity!

### Sell Your Services Online

OpenBazaar’s unique approach to an escrow account makes it even easier for a provider to list and bill their services. By setting up a moderated transaction a service seller can be sure that their client has the funds for contract they are agreeing to and upon successful completion of the work the funds can simply be released to the seller.

On OpenBazaar you can easily sell services for cryptocurrency. Here’s how.

#### 1. Define your service

What services do you sell? How do you usually price them? Many providers offer services by the hour or on a custom basis, but to list services for sale on OpenBazaar it’s easiest to start by “productizing” them, or structuring them to be constrained to a set cost. For example, if you provide language translation services you may create 3 different products with different prices. For example:

1. 100 - 200 words translated
2. 300 - 500 words translated
3. 500 - 750 words translated

#### 2. Create your listings

Once you have your services defined you can create listings for them on OpenBazaar. Create a **new listing** and under **Type**, select “**Service**.”

Give it a great **title** and **description** that relates to keywords people may use in search that will help them find it easily. Make sure to describe exactly what a buyer will receive and consider adding more information such as examples of past work or testimonials to make the offer compelling.

Include at least 1 great **image** that describes your service such as a photo of you providing the service or an photo of the completed service with simple text overlaid, such as “500-700 Words Translated English to Chinese.” 

**Tags** can be added to boost the searchability of your item. Include obvious ones that relate to the item itself like “website design” or “manuscript editing,” then more as relates to broader categories it represents such as “business or “writing.”

A **category** is to help keep your store organized. If you plan to sell both "software development" and "language translation," you’d just type in the appropriate category for the appropriate listing.

**Variants** and **inventory** can likely be left blank. These are helpful for things like physical goods where you may offer the exact same shirt but in 3 different colors and you only have a certain number of each. If you have variations with your services it is generally a good approach to create separate listings for each.

With the **return policy** you can set this up however you’d like. You may want to say no refunds or perhaps offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee with a full refund option. 

**Terms & conditions** can be added if you have any conditions or advisories you want to make people aware of when accessing or using your digital good.

Select the **coins** you’d like to receive as payment: [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org), [Bitcoin Cash](https://bitcoincash.org), [Litecoin](https://litecoin.org) and/or [Zcash](https://z.cash). it can be just one of them or any combination.


#### 3. Share your services from OpenBazaar.com 

OpenBazaar is a marketplace where people can browse and discover the items that you have for sale—but that’s not the only way they can find them!
