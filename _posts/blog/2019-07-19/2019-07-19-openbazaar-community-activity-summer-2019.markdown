This year has been an exciting time across the cryptocurrency space. Many projects are taking deeper root and putting out more practical and easy to use applications that enable people to do more with the coins they love. They’re making exciting strides getting the power of (notoriously hard-to-use!) decentralized networks into people’s hands. The OpenBazaar community has seen a surge of great activity lately too doing just the same! 

**Here are some of the biggest things going on in the OpenBazaar community this summer:**

- [Haven](https://gethaven.app) release is imminent! Haven is the first full-featured mobile app for using the OpenBazaar network. It is developed by [OB1](https://ob1.io), the company leading the development of the open-source OpenBazaar protocol. It has an exciting new social posting feature and makes it incredibly convenient to shop, sell and chat privately on the OpenBazaar network from your iOS or Android device. Haven is wrapping up its testing phase now and will be launching very soon. To be the first to know when it’s live, get on the waitlist at [gethaven.app](https://gethaven.app) 

- [Zokos](https://zokos.com/blog/site/public/2019/02/21/Announcing%20Zokos%20Beta/) is a new service that helps you setup your store on OpenBazaar in less than a minute on the web for free. This tool makes it easy for vendors to manage a store on the web rather than through the desktop application and offers some features to make their store management more convenient.

- For anyone interested in developing their own [search engine for OpenBazaar](https://openbazaar.org/blog/how-to-build-a-search-engine-for-openbazaar/), the same party that produced Zokos also open-sourced their search engine code called [Rawflood](https://zokos.com/blog/site/public/2019/04/04/Introducing%20RawFlood/).

- A community member has worked up a [proof of concept for Monero integration into OpenBazaar](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-go/issues/1638).

- A couple of the core developers of OpenBazaar attended IPFS Camp earlier this month to connect with the team deveopling IPFS and other projects that are using the protocol like OpenBazaar is. Here’s a [recap of the event from the IPFS team](https://blog.ipfs.io/2019-07-08-ipfs-camp-recap/ ).
