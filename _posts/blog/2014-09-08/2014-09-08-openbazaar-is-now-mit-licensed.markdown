We are happy to announce that we decided to release OpenBazaar under the [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). OpenBazaar had previously been released under [AGPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License). After [lengthy](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar/issues/410) [discussions](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar/issues/402) on the matter, the team arrived at the consensus to move forward with [relicensing under MIT](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar/blob/master/LICENSE.md). We believe the MIT license will help us better achieve our vision of building a platform of free trade, where anyone can exchange goods and services via the Internet in an uncensored and privacy-respecting manner. We feel it is crucial to publish our code under a very permissive open source license in order to let people freely build software upon our platform as they see fit. While we're building the canonical OpenBazaar node software, we believe the power and accessibility of the OpenBazaar network will thrive through the use of a multitude of clients who have access to our secure, pseudonymous, and decentralized system of trade. We expect others to build both commercial and free clients that can access our network, leverage the versatility of the Ricardian contract system, utilize powerful blockchain-based transactions to ensure safety, and support their own systems with our trust and identity service. By releasing under MIT, we are allowing these things to happen, and we hope this will, in turn, empower the OpenBazaar network to widen. This is our way of saying we invite you to participate in our platform, whoever you may be. We hope this will encourage developers to start building code which makes use of these virtues and feel free to base it on our own code, so that, together, we can create a world where people can trade with freedom and safety.
