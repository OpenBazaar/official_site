**Chat log:**

[10:12] Jacob Long: Does that include erc20?

[10:12] JoshJ: Eventually.

[10:12] mg (OB1): It will not include ERC-20 when ETH initially launches, but we will chase it shortly afterward.

[10:13] Jacob Long: USDC/DAI will help significantly with adoption IMO

[10:21] Jacob Long: I have been having many issues with disputes relating to the communication 
failures...but hopefully these relay nodes help significantly

[10:24] Jacob Long: Great job everyone!

[10:28] Jacob Long: Well...being able to enter the same seed would handle that
