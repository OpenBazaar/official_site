### Last week

#### Back end

API documentation rough draft completed. Work on finalizing orders nearly completed. Can now create contracts, send funds to multisig, release funds from multisig and create vendor rating. Working on moderators being able to release funds. Fixed API calls. Reworked reputation system since previous version ran into unforeseen technical challenges.

#### Front end

Fixed various issues with image uploading, added the ability to upload a custom store image, added a custom color picker that was much better than the native HTML one, and began work on the store wizard. Also coordinated efforts by open source contributors on the currency conversion and miscellaneous tasks. Integrated the new and improved add/edit contract page into OpenBazaar-Client and lots of misc. style enhancements throughout the app.
