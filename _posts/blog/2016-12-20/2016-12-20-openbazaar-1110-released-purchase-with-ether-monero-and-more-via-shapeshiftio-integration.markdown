[![OpenBazaar 1.1.10 Released - Purchase with Ether, Monero and More Via ShapeShift.io Integration](OpenBazaar-1.1.10-Released-Purchase-with-Ether-Monero-and-More-Via-ShapeShift.io-Integration1.png)](OpenBazaar-1.1.10-Released-Purchase-with-Ether-Monero-and-More-Via-ShapeShift.io-Integration1.png)   Today we've released [version 1.1.10](http://openbazaar.org/download.html) with a special integration that we are excited to share. Since our launch we have received many requests for the ability to use other cryptocurrencies within OpenBazaar and [ShapeShift's Shifty Button](https://info.shapeshift.io/tools/shifty-button) provides a simple solution. A workable demonstration of this functionality was produced at the [hackathon OB1 co-hosted with Duosearch in London](https://blog.openbazaar.org/openbazaar-hackathon-with-duosearch-and-blockchain-money-in-london/#.WFlQ2bYrKV4) by Justin of [Duosearch](http://duosear.ch) and community member Barry.

  We have an incredible community full of people with excellent ideas and skills and this build wouldn't be possible without them. **Here is a summary of the new update from the press release issued by our friends at ShapeShift:**

> "Today [ShapeShift.io](http://ShapeShift.io), a blockchain asset exchange platform, has partnered with online bitcoin-enabled marketplace OpenBazaar via their integration of the ShapeShift Shifty Button. This integration allows OpenBazaar shoppers to purchase items from the decentralized, peer-to-peer site with Ethereum, Zcash, Ripple and dozens of other leading digital currencies beyond Bitcoin."

OpenBazaar shoppers are now able to purchase from OpenBazaar shops using Ethereum, Zcash or any of a variety of other cryptocurrencies. The integration is a great match for our decentralized marketplace as the Button’s code is free and open source and has been integrated by dozens of bitcoin-friendly merchants to broaden customer payment needs quickly and easily.
