We wrapped up the design and are now finishing testing a product that will make setting up an [OpenBazaar](http://openbazaar.org) shop incredibly simple. We'll release this service next week, so if you or someone you know wants to open an OpenBazaar shop, keep an eye out for that.

Front end
---------

**Current version**

*   The auto-reconnect code was removed--We may re-implement it later in a more robust manner
*   The duplicate user bug was fixed in Discover
*   The zoom and rotate buttons on the avatar in Settings/Page are disabled until one is loaded
*   Multiple minor bugs were fixed
