OpenBazaar is built on Bitcoin. However, our goal is to make OpenBazaar cryptocurrency agnostic, meaning people will be able to spend and receive in whatever cryptocurrency they choose. Thatâ€™s not a simple task, and it will take some time to get there. But before we achieve that goal there is still a way to use a wide variety of other cryptocurrencies in OpenBazaar.

OpenBazaar has a built-in wallet that allows you to easily pay for items with a single click. You can fund this wallet with various cryptocurrencies using the ShapeShift service.

The video below shows exactly how to do it. Trade free!
