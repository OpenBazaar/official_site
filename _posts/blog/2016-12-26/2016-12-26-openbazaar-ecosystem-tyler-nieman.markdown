In these posts we take a look at some unique members of the OpenBazaar ecosystem. Today we are featuring the evolving store [tsnieman](ob://afece52ae1f1c087b3a73953e03e94069243e407) by Tyler Nieman who has several items listed now including his original art prints, tech gear and web development services while he defines his focus. **That's part of the beauty of OpenBazaar, you don't have to have it all figured out to get started!** You can view Tyler Nieman's store [in your browser ](Pasted-image-at-2016_12_22-16_30.png)or on OpenBazaar [here](ob://afece52ae1f1c087b3a73953e03e94069243e407).   [![Tyler Nieman Store on OpenBazaar](https://blog.openbazaar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Pasted-image-at-2016_12_22-16_30-e1482442355814.png)](https://blog.openbazaar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Pasted-image-at-2016_12_22-16_30.png)   **Tell us a bit about yourself?** My name is Tyler Nieman and I'm a full-stack web developer/designer, artist, gamer, and general all-around nerd currently living in Tacoma, WA. I run [@tsnieman](ob://afece52ae1f1c087b3a73953e03e94069243e407) on OpenBazaar. **How did you find out about OpenBazaar?** Probably by means of some Bitcoin-related subreddit. I've been learning a lot more about decentralization and cryptocurrencies in general lately, and OpenBazaar is a big name in that space. **What do you make/sell?** A lot of different stuff with no real specialty carved out yet. Right now I've got: some 12x18 locally screen-printed posters of my original Fox-themed artwork, rare vinyl (The Weeknd's "Trilogy", hand-numbered), some computer parts, a mechanical keyboard (with some fun free keycaps!), and my own by-the-hour full-stack development and design services. **Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar?** I think decentralization is a very powerful concept and I'm excited to learn more about it. OpenBazaar seems like a great way to do that. It's proving a great way to learn about how decentralized markets can work, cryptocurrencies, open source development, and even just general server maintenance practice. It's a great way to network with other people in the space too. **How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far?** Fantastic for such an early version of the concept! I've only been up and running for a week or two, so I haven't had any real sales. I've made a purchase (shoutout to [Cryptobooks](ob://efece349f9830a6d6167c3bbc6ed3ce855277a8f)!) and I'm eagerly awaiting the arrival of "The Internet of Money", a book by Andreas Antonopoulos. I'm finding so many great shops online by so many talented people. I'm hoping to open up another shop or two with more focused themes, as I really believe in what OpenBazaar could be. **How familiar are you with Bitcoin?** I learned about it years ago, when it was first coming out, though I didn't get into playing with it until 2013 or so (what a shame, right?). It wasn't until the last year or two that it really started to become a serious hobby/interest. Since then, I've consumed a lot of Satoshi's writings, bought a few hardware wallets (shoutout to [LedgerHQ](ob://f71cc867c98c171ddbf0d093c3f1046294e81279) \-\- check out their OpenBazaar shop!), got a few friends interested, dabbled in other cryptoassets, started connecting people with Bitcoin in the area, and recently started a [local Tacoma Bitcoin interest group](https://www.meetup.com/Tacoma-Bitcoin-Network/). I'm hoping to compile some educational material and educate more local folk soon. **What changes would you like to see in OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you?** Aside from all the awesome work coming in OpenBazaar 2.0, more folks on the platform and shopping would be the biggest improvement. I would also really love if there was a way to see some analytics like number of vendors online (and over time), number of sales per day, etc, though I imagine that getting people on OpenBazaar and making sales is first priority. I'm excited to see how [OB1](http://ob1.io) helps grow OpenBazaar's community and tech with their most recent round of fundraising. _Tyler cited this video OB1 CEO Brian Hoffman made recently that demonstrates some of the development work to date toward Milestone 1 of version 2.0:_   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOHfPsSzyNg
