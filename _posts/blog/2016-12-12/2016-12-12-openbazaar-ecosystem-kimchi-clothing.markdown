I been living outside of the U.S. since 2008. **Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar?** I am selling on open OB because I want to earn income in bitcoin that will cover my living expenses and build a savings. I believe in Bitcoin and the movement. I want to become an advocate for the community. **What do you make/sell?** I sell socks and I tailor suits from South Korea right now. **How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far?** I need to setup hosting my store on a server instead of my laptop. That way I can be open 24/7. (**UPDATE**: the shop has been moved to a Digital Ocean VPS using [OB1](http://ob1.io)'s [Deploy](http://deploy.ob1.io) tool!) **How familiar are you with Bitcoin?** I am super familiar in bitcoin. I am saving and doing business with bitcoin. **What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you?** Right now, I don't see any changes since I am still learning how to use it like a pro.   _**BONUS**: Check out this special video Jason made that is the first in his new series discussing blockchain!_ https://youtu.be/j2GMPwVSORE
