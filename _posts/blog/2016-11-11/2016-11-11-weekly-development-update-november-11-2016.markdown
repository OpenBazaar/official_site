*   Cleaned up the Transaction section
*   Wired in the ability to delete a listing from both the Listing Card and the Listing Detail modal
*   Worked on displaying a pop in message on the Store and Listing Detail modal when the user has changed some listing data and recommending they refresh the view
*   Started to work on the 'list' view style view of the Store (as opposed to the 'grid' view style)
