In [these posts](https://blog.openbazaar.org/snapshot-of-the-openbazaar-ecosystem-at-the-beginning/) we take a look at some unique members of the OpenBazaar ecosystem. Today we interview a vendor selling comic books, Crypto Collectibles, who has one of the largest inventories on the network. You can find Crypto Collectibles on OpenBazaar at [@crypto_collectibles/store](ob://@crypto_collectibles/store), and on Duosearch [here](https://duosear.ch/@crypto_collectibles).

Crypto Collectibles store currently has 872 listings, making it the second largest store on the network. The store has been around since OpenBazaar launched in April, and has been active in the Slack community, the subreddit, and on Twitter.

His store has a big variety of comic books; I've purchased twice from him myself, including an old Casper comic for my daughter.

**Tell us a bit about yourself?** Crypto Collectibles was actually started over two years ago through a merchant hosting site Moolah.io, accepting payments for comic books in Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin, while having a sister store open on Etsy for products that fit into their 'antique' rule, being 20 years or older.  History was not kind to Moolah.io unfortunately for myself and all other stores that were using the hosting services, so comics were limited to being sold on Etsy for the past couple of years. **What do you sell?** Mostly comic books at the moment, but general geek merchandise, promotional items, and or collectibles of any sort is up for sale. \[caption id="attachment_1028" align="aligncenter" width="1074"\][![Snapshot from his Duosear.ch page](Screenshot-from-2016-08-16-13-37-27.png)](Screenshot-from-2016-08-16-13-37-27.png) Snapshot from his Duosear.ch page\[/caption\] **Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar?** Multiple reasons, supporting crypto, supporting meaningful new tech, and of course no listing fees with maximum possible audience. **How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far?** Rough moments, but mostly good.   I feel slightly more comfortable in a Linux environment, that is a weird bonus that has come from this experience as an early adopter that I think users who are jumping on to OpenBazaar now will never have to worry about dealing with.  It is their loss, but the point and click ease that we all desire a Bitcoin app would have where it is so easy anyone can do it, is just around the corner with OpenBazaar.   My experience from using OpenBazaar from day one until now has shown OB1 devs are working every single day, there is a ton of other people into Bitcoin who can code who are helping the OB1 devs, every issue seems to be being addressed directly now or is on the roadmap. **How familiar are you with Bitcoin?** Fairly to very. **What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you?** Stability. Little tweaks here and there, the little additions.  An example for me would be multiple items can be combined and have just one shipping cost. ** Anything else you'd like to say?** Best of luck to any new stores being created.  To those who have tried OpenBazaar in the past but was there in the first month of release when things were a little borked, give it a spin again, check out DuoSear.ch or Bazaar Hound the mobile app, make a purchase, be forgiving as an early adopter of something new, tell a friend, support crypto.
