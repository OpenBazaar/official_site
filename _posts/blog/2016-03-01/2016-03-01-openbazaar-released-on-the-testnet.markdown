[![downloadOpenBazaar](downloadOpenBazaar.png)](downloadOpenBazaar.png) OpenBazaar is now fully functional on the testnet. We welcome rigorous testing from the community to ensure everything is functioning properly. You can download the testnet version [here](http://openbazaar.org/). After we're confident of the stability and functionality of the product, we'll transition to the main net and OpenBazaar will be open for business.
