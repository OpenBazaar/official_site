**Summary:** Happy new year! We're back in the grind and have new things we are working hard on in the OpenBazaar environment. Milestone 1 is imminent and will be released soon. **Milestone 1 means the application is ready for basic testing of some core features like the following:**

*   Users can download and install the client and server from Github, and use it to fill in their profile, store info, and post listings
*   The network can host listings, stores, and user profiles
*   Users can follow and unfollow
