In [these posts](https://blog.openbazaar.org/category/ecosystem/#.WJi7LLYrKV4) we take a look at some unique members of the OpenBazaar ecosystem and share their stores. In this post we are exploring a store that boasts a brand you may already know called BMW. Yes, like the cars! But no, while cars _could_ be sold through OpenBazaar, they arenâ€™t here at the moment, but you can get someÂ great promotional items available inÂ **BMW M Power Store.**Â You can check it outÂ [in your browserÂ ](https://duosear.ch/@bmwmpower)or on OpenBazaar [here](ob://3c5752ac73b1075112b09d969851bd5c93a52b9f).

_The owner of this store is choosing to remain anonymous but still took the time to share about their experience and whatâ€™s motivated them to sell on OpenBazaar!_

**Tell us a bit about yourself. Who are you and what do you make/sell?**

I live in Munich, Germany but originally I was born in Bulgaria. I own a BMW sports car and I am a big fan of the brand. I work in a branch of BMW Group in Munich and use OpenBazaar to promote the brand as well.

**How familiar are you with Bitcoin?**

I believe Bitcoin is the invention of our generation and is the next big thing after the Internet.I am not a tech guy so I donâ€™t have much to say about development but I do support this technology as much as I can. I use it as payment when possible, just some small transactions in order to showÂ my support, and I use to trade it against some alts in an exchange.Â I am not very familiar with trading so I donâ€™t do this much, though.

Most of all, I am person who doesnâ€™tÂ support the power of governments and banks over people so any chance I have in life to disruptÂ the System I embrace with love ![ðŸ™‚](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/svg/1f642.svg) Peer 2 Peer trading and for sure Bitcoin are twoÂ things that allow me to do this in a practical way.

**How did you find out about OpenBazaar?**

I first read about it on Twitter and thought Iâ€™dÂ give a shot!

**Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar?**

I use Bitcoin in my daily life, I am a fan of BMW, and I support the anti-bank and agorism movements. Those 3 things combine perfectly in OpenBazaar!

**How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far?**

I donâ€™t earn anything for myself by sellingÂ the BMW items that I do in OpenBazaar, I just do it for theÂ pleasure of promoting the brand and promoting the use of Bitcoin. The OB community is very wise and so far anyÂ small issues that I have had are resolved quickly and easy by the members in Slack! OB1 Co-Founder Dr. Washington Sanchez has also helped me a lot running myÂ nodes and I really appreciate the personal care.
