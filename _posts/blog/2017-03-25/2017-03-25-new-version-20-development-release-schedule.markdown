OpenBazaar version 2.0 development continues, and we’ve decided to change our development release schedule. Previously we posted our roadmap which contained various [milestones](https://trello.com/b/dF6ymHGU/openbazaar-high-level-roadmap) where we would create developer releases for people to test new functionality. We’re still keeping the milestones, and will still publish releases when we reach each new milestone, but in order to get more frequent testing and community feedback _we’ll also be publishing developer builds every two weeks_. We develop based on two week sprint periods, so at the end of each sprint we’ll release a new build for people to test.

Yesterday was the last day of our current sprint, and so we’re releasing the first build – version 2.0.1 – under this new schedule. Note that these are developer builds which are meant to be used **for testing only**. You can find the [latest build here](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-desktop/releases).
