I watched them grow to a serious venture and am thoroughly impressed. **What do you make/sell?** What I started doing on OpenBazaar is offering discount on products at [Amazon.com](https://amazon.com), similar to [purse.io](https://purse.io/). I am offering more of a tailored experience and better customer service and of course better rates. **Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar?** I want to facilitate the usage of Bitcoin for those who use it as currency. Some people want to use BTC for every purchase they can.

> I feel like I can help Bitcoin be perceived as the currency of the internet through OpenBazaar's platform.

**How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far?** Setup on OpenBazaar was an absolute breeze. I find the UI to be great. Plenty of options for a vendor to customize a store. **How familiar are you with Bitcoin?** I am a long-term Bitcoin supporter. I've been involved in Bitcoin since 2010.
