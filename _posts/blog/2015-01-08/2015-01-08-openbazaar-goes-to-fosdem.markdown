We're joining forces from all over the world:

*   Project leader [Brian Hoffman](https://github.com/hoffmabc) from Washington DC
*   Operations leader [Sam Patterson](https://onename.io/sampatt) from Virginia
*   Developers [Nikolaos Korasidis](https://github.com/renelvon) (Code quality) and [Giannis Adamopoulos](https://github.com/yagoulas) (Windows) from Athens, Greece

So, come and say hello. We'll be giving [a 20-minute lightning talk on Sunday afternoon](5606606522_f2b12f52bf_z.jpgschedule/event/openbazaar/). But most importantly, we'll stick around and will be happy to demo OpenBazaar to you on Saturday and Sunday, answer your questions, talk about code, trade, law, anonymity, privacy, politics, and bitcoin, and discuss our vision for the future. Of course, we won't be skipping the traditional FOSDEM beer either. We'll be happy to present you our GPG keys so that you can verify their authenticity in person. We're very much looking forward to meeting you! **See you in Brussels!**
