Andreas Antonopoulos - security expert, author and Bitcoin evangelist - went on the Joe Rogan Experience to discuss Bitcoin and other technologies. He announced his new book, The Internet of Money, and also announced that he is selling his book on OpenBazaar. Listen to Andreas explain OpenBazaar to Rogan in the video. You can find the new book for sale on his [OpenBazaar store](https://duosear.ch/efece349f9830a6d6167c3bbc6ed3ce855277a8f). If you have a book - or anything else - that you'd like to sell for Bitcoin, try out [OpenBazaar](https://openbazaar.org/).
