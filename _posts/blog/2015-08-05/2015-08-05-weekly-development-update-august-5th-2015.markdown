### Last week

#### Back end

We've been building out contract classes, making sure we have all the different data needed. This has also lead to a focus on database work. Fixed some networking issues in the network repo.

#### Front end

In the prototype, notifications have been added. Improvements have been made to the messaging tool, as well as the item creation section. Work has now begun on taking the prototype and building a repo for the Electron app itself. A skeleton of the app has been created to determine how best to wire up the javascript. Work on the REST API.

### This week

Work on moderation selection both in back and front end. A new repository taking the prototype and making it a usable Electron app is being created. Our final layout for the repositories is being determined now and will be announced next week. Work on the REST API continues.
