The [Milestone 1 developer release of OpenBazaar 2.0](https://blog.openbazaar.org/milestone-1-developer-release-for-openbazaar-2-0/#.WJTcdrYrLOQ) is available and **Milestone 2 will be released in early April!**

Here is a recap of the capabilities of the Milestone 1 release:

_**Milestone 1 Summary**_

_This release is meant solely for developers and those building or intending to build on top of the OpenBazaar platform. You can read more about what the release entails [here](https://blog.openbazaar.org/milestone-1-developer-release-for-openbazaar-2-0/#.WIJ8GrYrKV4)._

_Since this is a release meant for development, the functions available in Milestone 1 are very minimal. They include:_

*   _Users can download and install the client and server from Github, and use it to fill in their profile, store info, and post listings_
*   _The network can host listings, stores, and user profiles_
*   _Users can follow and unfollow_

* * *

Here is what’s been happening in the OpenBazaar development universe so far in March:

### Version 2.0

*   Managing a variety of pull requests (PRs)
