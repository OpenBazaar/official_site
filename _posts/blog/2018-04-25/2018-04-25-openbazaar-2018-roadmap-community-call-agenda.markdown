We are looking forward to seeing you this **Thursday, April 26th at 11am EST** to discuss the 2018 development roadmap and determine some priorities together as a community! Since we are expecting quite a few attendees, we want to share a brief agenda so everyone knows what to expect and we can keep things sane(ish!)

* **Introductions** – Meet the OB1 development team
* **Recent & Upcoming Releases**
*  [2018 Roadmap]() **Overview** – Check this out ahead of time so that you know what is up for discussion!
