We are working on a product that will make setting up an OpenBazaar shop incredibly easy. This week we worked through fixing an issue that surfaced but it will be ready very soon, so if you or someone you know is ready to open an OpenBazaar shop but would like to keep it simple, keep an eye out for our launch!
