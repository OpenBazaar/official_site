Last week a few members of our team had the opportunity to travel to London to co-host the first organized [OpenBazaar hackathon](https://www.meetup.com/openbazaar/events/232373532/) along with [Duosearch](http://duosear.ch) and our CEO, Brian Hoffman, presented the next day at [Blockchain: Money](https://conference.bitcoin.com). On November 5th, the **hackathon** was hosted in the beautiful Canary Wharf business district at [Level39](http://www.level39.co/), Europe's largest technology accelerator for finance, retail, cyber-security and future cities technology companies​. The teams worked all day on their projects and we ended up with 7 demos at the end! See the summary below:

_Again mistaken, this was #7!_ The results were impressive, we were intrigued to see how many working projects the attendees produced. This kind of collaboration is an important part of the continued evolution of OpenBazaar and we are so glad to know there is such support and understanding for the project out there. Very soon will be working to facilitate more of these kinds of events!

### In which places around the world would you like to see more hackathons organized?

**November 6th & 7th was Blockchain: Money** at [etc. Venues 155 Bishopsgate](https://www.etcvenues.co.uk/venues/155bishopsgate), an exceptional conference venue in the heart of the city. It hosted an excellent lineup across 2 full days of thought leaders within the blockchain and financial technology space. The event had a significant focus on Bitcoin specifically within the blockchain sphere which we were pleased to see. It was great to connect with friends new and old and to support Brian's presentation of [OpenBazaar](http://openbazaar.org) in the context of its present and evolving abilities to facilitate trade directly on top of Bitcoin.

**A big thanks to Duosearch and the Blockchain: Money team** for having us join them in these events and to everyone who attended either or both with us! We are excited to travel around the world and see the ways Bitcoin is being adopted and the kind of impact OpenBazaar is having for more and more people wanting to help facilitate truly free trade with no borders. **Here are a few more images of some of the amazing views we experienced around London:** \[gallery columns="4" ids="1370,1369,1367,1368" orderby="rand"\]
