_Note: This blog post is outdated. Read [this article](https://blog.openbazaar.org/three-openbazaar-code-repositories-created/) for the latest code._ As OpenBazaar nears its initial beta release at the end of August, we decided to launch a blog in order to keep the community updated on our progress. If you'd like to be alerted to new blog posts or announcements, sign up for our [mailing list](http://lists.openbazaar.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openbazaar).

### Wait, what is OpenBazaar again?

Glad you asked. We wrote an [introductory article](https://blog.openbazaar.org/what-is-openbazaar/) just for you. If you can't be bothered, here's the tl;dr: OpenBazaar is a decentralized network that allows for peer to peer commerce without fees or censorship.

### How can I help?

Over the month of August we need folks with some amount of tech savvy (and Linux) to do some alpha testing, report bugs, and make suggestions for improvement. You can report bugs or request enhancements through the [Issues section](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar/issues) on our Github page. To get a node up and running on Linux, check out the [build instructions](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar/wiki/Build-Instructions) (and drop into #OpenBazaar on Freenode IRC if you need help). We're making progress on a Windows version, but it's not stable yet. The Mac version hasn't started yet. We'll have one eventually.

### But I'm not tech savvy; I don't use Linux!

That's fine, though you can't help with early testing you can sign up for the mailing list to be alerted when we start beta testing. You can also help by [donating Bitcoin](https://blockchain.info/address/16uniUFpbhrAxAWMZ9qEkcT9Wf34ETB4Tt) to the project, which helps us do things like running seed servers, host this website, and present OpenBazaar at conferences like Bitcoin in the Beltway or the upcoming Cryptolina conference. Of course, you can also help by spreading the word...we need as many developers and Bitcoiners to be aware of OpenBazaar as possible!

### How can I contact you?

We're very active on IRC on Freenode at #openbazaar, visit us at http://forum.openbazaar.org, or shoot us an email at project@openbazaar.org.
