In [these posts](Screen-Shot-2016-10-10-at-3.24.45-PM.png) we take a look at some unique members of the OpenBazaar ecosystem. Today our featured shop is Stone Banana, a one-of-a-kind custom apparel shop featuring great custom artwork! You can find Stone Banana on [OpenBazaar](ob://2399837001df1701983afee9effee609b1e5fb83), on [Duosearch](https://duosear.ch/@stonebanana) and at [StoneBanana.com](https://www.stonebanana.com/) [![Stone Banana Apparel on OpenBazaar](https://blog.openbazaar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-10-at-3.24.45-PM-1024x745.png)](https://blog.openbazaar.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-10-at-3.24.45-PM.png) **Tell us a bit about yourself?** I’m a psych/neuroscience lab manager at Purdue by day ([sanghalab.com](http://sanghalab.com)) and an aspiring entrepreneur by night. It was less than a year ago that I realized I wanted to create my own business. Artistic design has always been an interest of mine, and I had sort of stumbled into t-shirt design around the same time I became interested in starting a business. So, Stone Banana became my first go at it! **What do you make?** Stone Banana makes graphic tees. I create the designs, sometimes starting from scratch, sometimes from my other artwork, and sometimes from the photography of others (with their permission :)) I have some other products that I’m currently designing, and hope to use the profits from t-shirts to bring these to market. **Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar?** I use OpenBazaar because I love bitcoin and am super excited to participate in a truly open-source market. I’ve done a bit of cryptocurrency mining/trading in the past, but I never felt like I was bringing bitcoin any closer to being mainstream. Not being a coder, participating in OpenBazaar has been a way for me to help advance not only bitcoin, but the idea of truly peer-to-peer markets. (Beyond just talking to my friends and family about it!) **How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far?** It’s been great! Of course I’m very excited for 2.0 and the features that come with it, but 1.0 has done the job of providing a fee-free trading platform that’s allowed my shop to be discovered as well as to complete many transactions successfully! **How familiar are you with Bitcoin?** Fairly familiar. I’ve done a good bit of reading and watching Andreas (among others :)) speak on the topic over the last 3 years. I’ve done some mining and trading, and pretty much been an advocate since I first found out about it! But, I’ve never actually bought anything besides other currencies and cloud mining until OpenBazaar! **What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you?** I think the main thing for me right now would be an improved product upload interface, as well as selector options within each product such as size, color etc. **What products/promos are you featuring this season?** I have a great new design in my shop for Halloween! We’ll also be doing a 10% discount through October--then stay connected to see what I'll be doing for Bitcoin Black Friday!
