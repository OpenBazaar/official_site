OpenBazaar is not like a regular online marketplace.

It’s a _decentralized_ online marketplace.

OpenBazaar is like its own separate part of the internet. It’s a network of users who connect directly to one another instead of to centralized websites like Amazon or Ebay. 

The decentralized architecture that makes it powerful can also make it a bit hard to understand at first.

[OB1](https://ob1.io), the team leading the development of OpenBazaar, has designed a few things that make it easier to use.

> Note that these items are add-ons and are [less decentralized](https://openbazaar.org/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-decentralization/) than the network itself. They make shopping easier but they do not change the decentralized protocol nor the privacy or security of your transactions.

### 1. Easy discovery

![Search Providers in OpenBazaar](Search Providers in OpenBazaar.gif "Search Providers in OpenBazaar")

There are [search engines](https://openbazaar.org/blog/decentralized-search-and-content-discovery-on-openbazaar/) within the application that help you discover items. OB1 created the first search engine available within OpenBazaar but anyone else is welcome to build and add their own.

### 2. Categories and tags

![Add categories to your OpenBazaar listing](Add categories to your OpenBazaar listing.gif "Add categories to your OpenBazaar listing")

Find just what you’re looking for by using the different controls like [categories and tags](https://openbazaar.org/blog/how-to-get-more-buyers-on-openbazaar-with-categories-and-tags/) that are available in search. With OB1 search you can choose from a selection of suggested categories or search by shipping location, coin payment type, moderator type, or rating. You can also toggle adult filters on and off or search within different product types including physical goods, cryptocurrencies, digital goods, and services.

### 3. Browse-only website

![OpenBazaar Website Browsing Experience.gif](OpenBazaar Website Browsing Experience.gif "OpenBazaar Website Browsing Experience.gif")


There is now a [website](https://openbazaar.com/) where buyers can see what’s available and start shopping right in their browser! Check it out at OpenBazaar.com or from within the application click "View on web" in the top right of the address bar to view a store or item page in your browser.

### Conclusion

Decentralization is an exciting new evolution in web technology, but it’s definitely still new. There are [many challenges to overcome when building decentralized applications](https://openbazaar.org/blog/how-decentralized-application-development-nearly-destroyed-my-world/) but we are optimistic about industry progress. Working through these challenges is a point of pride for the development team and we are excited to keep building a better and better user experience for OpenBazaar.
