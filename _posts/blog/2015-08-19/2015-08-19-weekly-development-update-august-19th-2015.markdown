### Last week

#### Back end

Encrypted messaging now working. Unit test coverage improved. Work on installer has begun. The final structure for the repositories has [been established](https://blog.openbazaar.org/three-openbazaar-code-repositories-created/).

#### Front end

Prototype: Updated the shipping step in the payment flow. Integrated dispute resolution into the order/purchase modal and designed the first time store setup experience. Added blocking/unblocking users. Front end repository: Set up skeleton of new client, created base models and views, built initial CSS framework with reusable modular classes, got onboarding and the home page working with fake data.

### This week

Finalizing prototype and focusing on implementing prototype into the OpenBazaar-Client repository. More work on the APIs in order to begin testing front and back end together.
