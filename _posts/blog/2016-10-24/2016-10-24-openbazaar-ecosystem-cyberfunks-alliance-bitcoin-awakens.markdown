In [these posts](ob-cyberfunksalliance-store.png) we take a look at some unique members of the OpenBazaar ecosystem. Today our featured shop is **Cyberfunks Alliance**'s event in Austin, TX called **Bitcoin Awakens**. This unique event is designed to help new users get oriented to acquiring and using Bitcoin through a fun and interactive game. You can find tickets to the event on [OpenBazaar](ob://@bitcoinawakens) and learn more about their philanthropic mission by reading on! **Tell us a bit about yourself?** ob-cyberfunksalliance-store.png) and our aim is to create a broadly-based, widely-accessible, deeply-entrenched network of Urban, tech-savvy Bitcoin enthusiasts in Austin, TX! At Cyberfunks, we directly address the pain points for user adoption and appeal, such as user experience, price volatility, security, and use cases in the local community. Most Bitcoin conferences spend more time giving presentations and targeting those already in the bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem. Real engagement. Real use. Real value. An event where everyone leaves Bitcoin literate. Reframing Bitcoin as an immersive adventure will create the peak experiences necessary to shorten the adoption curve from early adopters to the early majority. **What do you make or sell?** We sell tickets to our event [Bitcoin Awakens](ob-cyberfunksalliance-store.png) and provide a way for our partner, the [Central Texas Food Bank](ob-cyberfunksalliance-store.png), to accept donations to fight hunger in over 21 counties in Texas. [“Bitcoin Awakens” Event Tickets on OpenBazaar](ob://@bitcoinawakens/store) Our inaugural event, Bitcoin Awakens, on Sunday, November 6th, 2016, 8AM - 8PM, at our headquarters, Urban Co-Lab in Austin, TX. Bitcoin literacy meets fun-filled adventures as players take center stage in a flood of competition, mystery, & camaraderie—based on scenarios from the Star Wars Universe. Teams of three (3) will solve up to 15 challenges throughout the city of Austin, TX to reveal the coordinates of a secret location for a victory party in honor of the mysterious creator of the Bitcoin protocol. Selling tickets for crypto events is a no-brainer because the OpenBazaar audience spans worldwide. Eventbrite, Meetup, and other event websites only reach a portion of the world’s population. With OpenBazaar, we sell tickets internationally to anyone, anywhere. Donations to the Central Texas Food Bank We are introducing a new way for the community to support one of our partners, the Central Texas Food Bank, by donating bitcoin through our OpenBazaar store. Bitcoin provides a means to make donations transparent, and through OpenBazaar, we are reaching people worldwide. To make donations transparent, we use the Food Bank's bitcoin address (1ARxKuBArW8XzJQNGoRC5RZBVqhb4Tx5yx) found on [centraltexasfoodbank.org/bitcoin](ob-cyberfunksalliance-store.pngbitcoin), and you can write off any donation made to the the Food Bank for tax purposes (optional, as anonymous donations are more than welcome!!!).     [![Cyberfunks Alliance Bitcoin Awakens Tickets on OpenBazaar](ob-cyberfunksalliance-store.png)](ob-cyberfunksalliance-store.png)     **Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar? ** The idea came to me after spending an absurd amount of time helping my mom donate to an organization. The amount of personal details and time required needed to make a simple donation was burdensome and unnecessary. The current donation model bombards people by stealing their time and attention, which is priceless, by inviting counterparty risk and friction to philanthropic campaigns, which removes a lot of incentive for people to give. OpenBazaar enables "zero-marginal-cost charities” with no interference with government regulation. It’s free to download and use. It’s permissionless, borderless, and available to anyone with a computer and internet connection. OpenBazaar removes many barriers that otherwise exist in banking and philanthropy. OpenBazaar donations can bring a lot of awareness to causes that need assistance while sending a message to the world about the viability of decentralized marketplace and microdonations. More stories about the “good” a decentralized application can do and the amount of people we can empower are the stories we plan to bring to the entire crypto ecosystem.   **How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far?** When I heard about OpenBazaar before the beta release, all I knew is I wanted to be involved. I joined the beta on day one and opened a luxury watch store with a friend from high school called [Justin Time](ob://@JustinTime). I am not a watch guy, but my buddy, who the director of timepieces at a well-respected diamond company in Dallas, TX, has years of experience in the industry. We decided to partner, and before I knew it, I was spending all my time learning about OpenBazaar. It has been exciting to see OpenBazaar stores, listings, and community grow. The OpenBazaar [Slack channel](http://slack.openbazaar.org) is an incredible resource for anyone to learn how to use OpenBazaar, regardless of eCommerce or technical experience. The [OB1](http://ob1.io) crew work like robots and are extremely responsive to questions. Also, OB1 CEO, Brian Hoffman, was the first to donate to the Food Bank while newly hired OB1 developer, Tyler Smith, provides [the server to host our store](ob://@obcentral). It truly is a community that all projects in this space can learn from.   **How familiar are you with Bitcoin?** We aren’t Satoshi, but we live Bitcoin daily. No movies or T.V. series provides the amount of comedy, drama (forks), tragedy (hacks), or overall entertainment that the Bitcoin community does. We teach Bitcoin literacy through Bitcoin Awakens and host weekly [Bitcoin Meetups every Monday in Austin, TX](http://www.meetup.com/The-Financial-Berlin-Wall-How-To-Get-Over-It/). You don’t need to know everything about Bitcoin & blockchain technologies and there there are plenty of ways to familiarize yourself with the concepts and theory of it. But, we want to teach people how to take advantage of Bitcoin and show them how to apply it in their own lives. We want them to experience Bitcoin and give them the knowledge and power to build a better life for themselves and their family.   **What changes would you like to see to OpenBazaar to make it more useful for you?** Most of the changes I look forward to will be implemented in version 2.0 (IPFS, Auctions, Inventory Management, statistics, etc.). However, I do have some suggestions:

1.  Remove the minimum listing price. This would enable micro-transactions and potentially, increase donations to charitable causes. With no minimum price, anyone would be able to list free items they need to get rid of or offer up volunteer opportunities.
2.  Store Templates and the ability to save drafts of store listings.
3.  Pre-schedule the date for listings to be posted.
4.  More third party integrations.

The Cyberfunks Alliance is onboarding potential customers and you can take advantage of the relationship with the customer right from the start. OB Stores interested in donating in-kind any Bitcoin novelty/paraphernalia, hosting services, crypto art, hardware wallets, etc., or offer discounts should reach out to us on our [Slack](http://www.cyberfunks.org/). Join us as we co-create the inroads for urban, tech-savvy smartphone users to leapfrog inefficient economic infrastructures and reduce dependency upon legacy financial systems in a way that is epic, lucrative and fun.
