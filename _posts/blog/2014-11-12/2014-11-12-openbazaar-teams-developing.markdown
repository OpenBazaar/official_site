_Note: This blog post is outdated. Read [this article](https://blog.openbazaar.org/three-openbazaar-code-repositories-created/) for the latest code._ Since the project began in April, the number of people contributing to the OpenBazaar project has steadily grown. We now have enough people to create small teams dedicated to specific areas. These teams will allow the project to focus on areas that are important, and not duplicate efforts. This team creation has already been occurring spontaneously, but we've decided to make it more formal as we keep developing the platform. It's likely that these teams, their mission, and their members will change over time as we figure out what works and what doesn't. As the project lead, [Brian Hoffman](https://onename.io/brianhoffman) will work with these teams to make sure they are heading in the right direction. Each team has their own mission, and the core mission of OpenBazaar is "To enable global free trade online." We've identified 11 areas we want to have teams focusing on;

1.  Code Quality
2.  Design & UX
3.  Legal
4.  Marketing
5.  Networking
6.  OB Developer Network
7.  OB Labs
8.  Operations & Recruiting
9.  Quality Assurance
10.  Security
11.  Windows
