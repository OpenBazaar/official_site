### Last week

Created video showing current progress.

#### Back end

Resolved miniupnpc install issue on Windows and continued worked on OS installers. Fixed networking bugs; network is much more stable. Created an [API page](https://drwasho.github.io/openbazaar-restapi-ui/) for testing both REST and Websockets API.

#### Front end

Added following and follower functionality. Added connected peers, routing table, server shutdown and app shutdown to admin panel. Address bar shows all user page states so you can navigate to subtabs on a user's page; created address bar [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gEH4SCa8g4BHiDuTdkGEEfV30Kijgrd_7iz5wawoRjk/edit?usp=sharing). Images have preloading placeholders. Added user page error status.
