> During the 2016 holiday weekend, global online sales have seen a significant nudge upwards. At the same time, payment card fraud increased by a whopping 20%. Consumer’s financial details are always at risk when dealing with payment cards these days. Bitcoin is a far safer option, as there is no sensitive personal information leaked during the transaction process. _**Source:** [2016 Holiday Shopping Fraud Report Shows Bitcoin Remains Most Secure](http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/12/03/2016-holiday-shopping-fraud-report-shows-bitcoin-remains-secure/)_

If you are active in the Bitcoin space this is likely no surprise to you, so accept this as more reinforcement that you are on the right path. Huzzah! Cheers to you, friend. But if you are still fairly new here (or have a friend or family member who is) then first, welcome! Second, here is a quick crash course in why you should use bitcoin as at least a _part_ of your 2016 holiday spending bonanza.

1.  **Bitcoin is stable.** Now in its 7th year of open development, Bitcoin is still the largest and most used cryptocurrency and has achieved a stability that [has rivaled that of gold](http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/04/19/is-bitcoin-becoming-more-stable-than-gold/). This solid status shows [no signs of stopping](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-price-achieves-stability-why-it-will-continue/).
2.  **Bitcoin is secure.** Like the article above states, no sensitive information can be leaked during a transaction online since it isn't transmitted to begin with. There's also no way to steal said non-existent information by scanning your handbag or wallet as you walk by!
3.  **There are lots of places to shop using bitcoin.** You can use bitcoin easily in any [OpenBazaar](http://openbazaar.org) store of course, or shop at many of the [ecommerce websites that now offer a bitcoin payment option](https://www.lifewire.com/big-sites-that-accept-bitcoin-payments-3485965). You can also browse other interesting marketplaces like [purse.io](http://purse.io).
4.  **It's the future.** It's becoming clear that the age of credit cards is in decline but the need for powerful, secure, international electronic payments is higher than ever. New advancements such as EMV technology are [only addressing a fraction of the problem with centralized credit](http://www.businessinsider.com/online-fraud-poses-major-threat-holiday-season-2016-11) and encountering [many logistical issues](http://qz.com/717876/the-chip-card-transition-in-the-us-has-been-a-disaster/) on the road to rollout. While credit companies and merchants continue to fight over how to bandage this leaking system, you don't have to wait to get ahead.
