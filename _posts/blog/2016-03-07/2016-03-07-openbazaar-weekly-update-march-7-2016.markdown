Update
------

We've been posting weekly [development updates](https://blog.openbazaar.org/tag/development/) for many months now. Since our testnet release on March 1st, we're now going to give updates on development through release notes when new versions are released. We will continue publishing weekly updates, which won't be focused on code changes but other information around the progress of the OpenBazaar software, network, and community.

Testnet Release
---------------

On March 1st we released the testnet version of OpenBazaar. Over the past week we've been excited to see so many people download and test OpenBazaar for themselves. Since OpenBazaar is purely peer to peer, there is no central server to collect exact numbers on how many users installed OpenBazaar since testnet launch, but we can see how many users [downloaded](http://www.somsubhra.com/github-release-stats/?username=Openbazaar&repository=OpenBazaar-Installer) the installers from the Github repositories. Version 1.0.6 and 1.0.7 have been downloaded more than 8,000 times over the past week. The OpenBazaar testnet now has hundreds of items people are buying and selling to test out the software. http://i.imgur.com/iLyxAry.gifv In addition, we've seen more than 100 new issues [opened](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar-Client/issues?page=2&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) on the client repository and 20 [opened](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/OpenBazaar-Server/issues) on the server repository. We appreciate so many people testing and reporting in order to make OpenBazaar ready for the upcoming main net release. Many testers took to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=OpenBazaar) to share updates and screenshots of their own OpenBazaar pages and stores. One tester made a video showing off the process of purchasing products, shown at the bottom of this post. The team is currently addressing the new open issues and responding to user feedback. Also, having so many users on the network has given us the ability to see how individual nodes respond to higher traffic. With this information we're now focusing on optimization. We will continue to put out new releases during this testing phase until we get enough testing and feedback to feel confident switching over to the main net. There is no set deadline yet for this transition.
