**Chat log:**

[10:09] chris.troutner: There have been some new hires and a lot of changes. Could we get a brief run-down of an org chart. Like who is kind of overseeing what subcomponents of OB?

[10:13] chris.troutner: I'd love to hear some details/preview of the API wallet vs Etherium. Technical difficulties/gotchas, etc. Other than the OB token, what is the goals of the Ethereum wallet?

[10:17] Gustavo Frederico: Hi - is there any known project for integration between OB and other traditional e-commerce platforms? (SAP Hybris, Oracle ATG commerce, Elastic Path, Magento, Sitecore, etc )

[10:21] Gustavo Frederico: Excellent!

[10:22] chris.troutner: Can you guys remind me on the difference between hitting the 'Reload Transactions' button vs deleting the header.bin file? 

[10:23] mg (OB): Reload button is a soft reset. Deleting the headers.bin is the hard reset. Let me know if you want more.

[10:23] chris.troutner: Thats good

[10:24] chris.troutner: Since we're on the topic of APIs and integrations, I'll put this link here to the node.js library for interfacing with the OB API:

[10:25] mg (OB): Gustavo, it sounds like you may have a use case in mind. If there is, I'd be curious what so we can make sure to improve those docs to that end.
