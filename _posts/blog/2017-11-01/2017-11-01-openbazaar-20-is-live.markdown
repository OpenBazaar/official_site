**OpenBazaar 2.0 is now live!**

[Download the new OpenBazaar 2.0](https://www.openbazaar.org/download/)

The beta was released in September, and we received significant help from the community testing out the application – thanks to all the testers for your help! After publishing six beta builds and seeing over 10,000 nodes launched in the beta, we’re now launching the full, open source 2.0 release. A full press release is posted at the end of this article.

<!--more-->

The 2.0 release is a completely new network, separate from the earlier version of the OpenBazaar network. We’ve learned much from the 1.0 version, and with this information we’ve made the new OpenBazaar one of the most user-friendly decentralized applications ever built.

New features
------------

OpenBazaar 2.0 includes many significant improvements over the first version.

**Offline stores**

Because this new version is built on IPFS, OpenBazaar stores can now be accessible to buyers even when they are offline. Stores and listings can now be re-seeded by other OpenBazaar users, meaning that if a store is seeded then buyers can purchase their listings even if they are offline.

**Search**

Third party search providers are now accessible from within the client. Search results are much faster and more accurate than they were before.

**Tor**

You can now use Tor with OpenBazaar 2.0 for more privacy. You can follow [these instructions](https://youtu.be/3taNePaXFoE) on Windows; instructions for OSX and Linux are [here.](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-desktop/wiki/Tor-Setup)

**Vendor tools**

This new version of OpenBazaar includes lots of added features for vendors, including inventory management, expanded shipping options, variants, and more.

**Built-in Wallet**

The new OpenBazaar has a built-in, Segwit-ready wallet in order to easily manage purchases and payments. It also allows more complicated transactions to occur automatically, such as 1-of-2 multisig for offline ordering and timelock to prevent funds from being stuck in an abandoned escrow transaction.
