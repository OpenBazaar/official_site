The Milestone 1 developer release of OpenBazaar 2.0 is now available! This release is meant solely for developers and those building or intending to build on top of the OpenBazaar platform. You can read more about what the release entails [here](https://blog.openbazaar.org/milestone-1-developer-release-for-openbazaar-2-0/#.WIJ8GrYrKV4). **Since this is a release meant for development, the functions available in Milestone 1 are very minimal. They include:**

*   Users can download and install the client and server from Github, and use it to fill in their profile, store info, and post listings
*   The network can host listings, stores, and user profiles
*   Users can follow and unfollow

### Here's a short walkthrough video by our UX / Design Lead, Mike Wolf:
