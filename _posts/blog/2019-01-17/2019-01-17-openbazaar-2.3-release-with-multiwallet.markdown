After several months of work OpenBazaar version 2.3 has [been released](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-desktop/releases). This is a major release which contains significant changes to how the OpenBazaar wallet functions. Because of the major changes in this release, we highly recommend you [backup your OpenBazaar data](https://openbazaar.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002761312-How-do-I-backup-my-store-) before you update.

Previously, OpenBazaar users were forced to use one cryptocurrency at a time. At startup they choose between Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Zcash. From that moment they could only use the coin they chose for all sales or purchases. If they wanted to use another coin, they had to run an entirely separate node.

With the 2.3 release OpenBazaar users are no longer forced to use a single cryptocurrency, but can buy, sell, send and receive multiple coins with the same wallet.

At the time of release there are four supported cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Zcash. Ethereum support is nearing completion and will be added soon, and other coins will be added later.

This video shows you what the multiwallet looks like and how to use it.
