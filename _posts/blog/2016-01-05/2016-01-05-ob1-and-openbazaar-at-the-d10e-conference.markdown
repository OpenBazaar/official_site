[![d10e](d10e.png)](d10e.png) Last year we attended the FOSDEM conference in Brussels to present OpenBazaar. We were able to meet lots of passionate and talented people, and since that trip we have been looking forward to another meeting in Europe. This year, the entire OB1 team will be attending the d10e conference in Amsterdam this February in order to present OpenBazaar to the wider decentralization movement. The [d10e conference](http://www.d10e.org/) \- February 17-18 in Amsterdam - focuses on the future of decentralization. We will be a speaker as well as offering an exhibit at the event. We hope to meet as many Bitcoiners and OpenBazaar community members as possible and we're excited to start pushing for adoption of the platform! **Edit**: Please note we are also holding our own event the day after the conference, on the 19th.
