Want to know what you can buy with Bitcoin? (Or Bitcoin Cash, or [Zcash](https://z.cash/)?)

All _kinds_ of things on OpenBazaar! It is a marketplace where you can buy and sell what you want and connect to people all around the world who are using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. 

**Here are 3 great stores for you to shop at today:**
<br>  
<br>  
#### [Casa Store](https://openbazaar.com/store/Qmd9hFFuueFrSR7YwUuAfirXXJ7ANZAMc5sx4HFxn7mPkc)

Casa began as a personal key management system then expanded to help their customers with hardware solutions as well. They are an Authorized Reseller for [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) and [Trezor](https://trezor.io/) and in September this year they expanded again. They began pre-releases for their brand new [Lightning Nodes](https://openbazaar.com/store/Qmd9hFFuueFrSR7YwUuAfirXXJ7ANZAMc5sx4HFxn7mPkc/casa-lightning-node) and sold out the first two shipment waves in the first day.

However, _lucky you_, it does seem that December shipments are still available on OpenBazaar...

#### Crypto Greeting Cards

If you are seeking high-quality, cryptocurrency-themed greeting cards for your fellow crypto-enthusiasts, they’ve got you covered.

If you want greeting cards that allow you to easily give the gift of cryptocurrency along with practical educational materials, they’ve _also_ got you covered!

**Here’s what they say about their store:**

 _“After being tired of the stacks of mundane, generic store-brand greeting cards, we set out to pair our passion in cryptocurrency with designs inspired by the community. Each card features a pre-generated cryptocurrency wallet that can be transferred to the recipient. Like cash in an envelope, only better. The goal is to inspire new participants to join the financial revolution!_

_Crypto Greeting Cards are an affordable way to introduce friends, family, and loved ones to cryptocurrency. After redeeming the card, the recipient will learn:_

* _How to set up a wallet app_
* _The difference between public address and private key_
* _An introduction to transactions (sweeping funds)_

_Is there any better way to spread cryptocurrency than kind words and a small gift?”_

We think not.
