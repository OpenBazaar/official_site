[OB1](https://ob1.io) believes open source is important for sharing knowledge and capability with everyone equally. An important way this works is by sharing the problem (and solution) with as many individuals as possible and enabling us all to collectively bootstrap new ideas and possibilities seemingly out of nothing. There are a ton of projects out there which are trying to improve the world which could use your help. Which is why we're excited about participating in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details) this year.

For the entire month of October people around the world are working to motivate each other to contribute to open source projects. **Until October 31st** you can [register your Github account](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details) and commit at least five pull requests to any public project hosted on Github to earn your own limited edition tee commemorating your participation.

OB1 has [curated a few issues](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-go/issues?g=is%3Aissue_is%3Aopen+label%3Ahacktoberfest) for OpenBazaar and will be adding more throughout the month. This is an ideal time for new developers to get involved in OpenBazaar and become familiar with the codebase. But don't wait long, some of them have been snatched up already.

**There are other ways to contribute to OpenBazaar, including:**

- Offering [translations](https://www.transifex.com/ob1/openbazaar/) for one of our 63 supported languages
- Assisting with code documentation
- Being [a brand ambassador at a local meetup](https://openbazaar.org/meet). 

While you may not get a Hacktoberfest tee for activities outside of Github, OB1 will hook you up with other sweet OpenBazaar gear including an [OpenBazaar tshirt](https://openbazaar.com/store/QmcUDmZK8PsPYWw5FRHKNZFjszm2K6e68BQSTpnJYUsML7/openbazaar-t-shirt) for completed work. To find out more, follow the above links to join the project you are interested in and mention **Hacktoberfest swag** when you contact us. The easiest way to connect is to join us on [Slack](https://openbazaar.org/slack) and let us know who you are and what you're up to. 

We're excited to meet you. Let's get started!
