We believe collaboration and individual empowerment are important which is why we love digital currencies like Bitcoin, and why we built OpenBazaar as an open source marketplace. We support events that bring together people from all around the world to encourage them to create and weâ€™re excited about participating in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details) this year.

During the month of October people around the world are working to motivate each other to contribute to open source projects. You can [register your Github account](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details) and commit at least five pull requests to any public project hosted on Github to earn your own limited edition tee commemorating your participation. **Hacktoberfest ends October 31st**.


OB1 has [curated a few issues](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-go/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahacktoberfest) for OpenBazaar and will be adding more throughout the month. This is an ideal time for new developers to get involved in OpenBazaar and become familiar with the codebase. Don't wait long! Some of these issues have been snatched up already, and we're already more than halfway through October.


**There are other ways to contribute to OpenBazaar, including:**

- Offering [translations](https://www.transifex.com/ob1/openbazaar/) for one of our 63 supported languages or translate a new language
- Assisting with code documentation
- Being [a brand ambassador at a local meetup](https://openbazaar.org/meet). 

While you may not get a Hacktoberfest tee for activities outside of Github, OB1 will hook you up with other sweet OpenBazaar gear including an [OpenBazaar tshirt](https://openbazaar.com/store/QmcUDmZK8PsPYWw5FRHKNZFjszm2K6e68BQSTpnJYUsML7/openbazaar-t-shirt) for completed work. To find out more, follow the above links to join the project you are interested in and mention **Hacktoberfest swag** when you contact us. The easiest way to connect is to join us on [Slack](https://openbazaar.org/slack) and let us know who you are and what you're up to. 

We're excited to meet you. Let's get started!
